I was one who was waiting for a great gameplay, but soon enough, the news about the troublesome development of this game was something that is seen on this game. Stuck between undestructible objects is something quite common, if it were not for the checkpoints, I would drop this game. Poor sound quality and mediocre animations are sadly, marks of this game.\nThe story is simple as the Duke Nukem 3D that I've played years ago. Aliens come to Earth and destroy everything, and Duke is the one to stop them. Duke's voice is the same, which I enjoyed very much. The NPCs acting are sufferable, maybe for comedy, but could not pull off. But Duke is still a badass no doubt, cliché over cliché, it's all there.\nThe graphics are quite nice, the attention on details are well done. The animation, not quite. NPCs and enemies, sometimes, moves like a tank. The level designs are great, nothing maze like or out of place for cluttering the map. I enjoyed the shrinked Duke maps, very creative ones. Most of the maps are quite big, but there isn't much to do with all that space.\nThe sounds are very unbalanced, any explosion or noisy factory map level, becomes an ear♥♥♥♥♥♥ Loudness isn't quality, and the sound designer just abused it, I had to lower the volume on the game, then after passing that certain part, raise it again. It was very annoying sometimes, imagine spending more than a minute on a puzzle noisy ambient. The music is quite nice, it shows up on battle moments mostly, and in cutscenes.\nOne detail of this game that I did not like is the lack of space to carry my weapons, on the first game, you can choose more than 4 weapons, which is restricted in this game. I had to always \"sacrifice\" a weapon for another. And no jet pack? I expected more, but maybe the troubled development is to blame.\nThe game is fun, there is no doubt in that. I had some great fun moments, and on others, not so much, due to the poor quality on software programming. I am not going to recommend this game, since it is very rushed, with obvious moments of terrible game planning. The impression that I have is that it released just to get rid of the project, instead of delivering something of better quality and worthy.\nIt could have been much more, and it was painful to hear Duke saying to a dead NPC that he wasn't going to be on the sequel.", "hours": 8.2, "username": "rodrst", "products": 158, "early_access": false},

That's like a C+, which in most school systems is a passing grade. Anyway, now for why I think this is quite possibly the single worst AAA first-person shooter of all time.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuke Nukem. It's a name that carries around a fair bit of weight, isn't it? The stoagie chomping, one-liner droping All-American mountain of machismo himself, and his... Let's just say varyingly successful game series. Well, how many people out there could say, in total honesty, that they thought Duke Nukem Forever was an amazing game? No rush, I'll give you a couple seconds. If you said \"Not many\", you'd be correct.\nAt its core, much like 2012's Doom 3: BFG Edition (Which I previously reviewed), Duke Nukem Forever is a game that has a good idea, and one that should be impossible to fudge up - A bombastic, balls-to-the-wall thrill ride starring none other than Duke \"I Ripped Off Ash Williams\" Nukem and a cast of characters mainly thrown together to be either cannon fodder, or exposititory elements. Oh, and the alien invaders, let's not forget them. There's a line, at the very start of the game, that rather ironically tells the entire story of Duke Nukem Forever's development:\n\"What about the game, Duke? Was it any good?\"\nDuke: \"After twelve fragging years, it should be.\"\nNow, that quip would have been funny - if it were true. See, Duke Nukem Forever started with a good idea, like I mentioned above. It was 1997, and 3D Realms was on a gosh darn roll with Duke Nukem 3D, third child in their Duke Nukem franchise (and the one people think of most when they think Duke Nukem), so they announced Duke Nukem Forever, for a release date that infamously devolved into the phrase, \"When it's done.\"\n\"Wait, did he just-?\" You may ask. \"Surely, he put the wrong year.\" Nope. Development of what would become Duke Nukem Forever started right after 3D's release, and from the start it was meant to be bigger - Better graphics, better gameplay, level interactivity beyond that of even 3D. Then 2001 rolled around, and while a trailer was released, there was nothing to show upon the game's scheduled release date. It wouldn't be until TEN. YEARS. LATER. That Duke Nukem Forever was released, as the dated, yet reasonably polished turd that it was, for PS3, Xbox 360 and finally, PC. For most of its development, Duke Nukem Forever was in a state known as \"Development Hell\", wherein an ip has a rather protracted development cycle, with Duke Forever being the poster child of the phrase, at least in the gaming world.\nIn terms of basic plot, you are Duke Nukem, machismo personified and savior of mankind due to some shenanigans that happend \"Twelve Years Ago\" which resulted in the Los Angeles area being largely destroyed, heavily damaged, or otherwise rendered uninhabitable. Of course, this quick rundown of Duke Nukem 3D largely ignores the two-dimensional shenanigans of Duke Nukum and Duke Nukem 2, so... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I guess. After mucking about in your casino called the Ladykiller (I'm assuming Duke's super creative nickname for his dong), you descend into the bowels of the property and have a friendly little chit-chat with the President and General Graves (One of, like, two returning characters from the 2001 build of the game. Actually, I think he's the ONLY returning character), who inform you that the aliens have, indeed, returned but that you are NOT to engage. Duke, being Duke, says \"Frack it, I'm taking matters into my own hands.\"\nThe combat in Duke Nukem Forever is, surprisingly enough, actually rather decent, once you get used to the inherently slightly-too-high-yet-not-high-enough mouse sensitivity and Duke's movement speed which is somewhere between \"Geriatric Ninja\" and \"Obese Toddler\". The weapons feel rather punchy (except for the fists, ironically enough), and they all deal a decent amount of damage, both to Duke and foe. It's rather difficult to play favorites for \"Favorite Weapon in Duke Forever\", since most of them are what one would expect from a mid-late 90s shooter - The pistol is practically useless, the Shotgun is a beast in close quarters and the Ripper is the game's dedicated assault rifle. New arrival the Railgun tries to add a bit of variety to the mix, but ultimately just doesn't make the gunplay as exciting as one would expect from the God Damn Duke.\nActually, let's side track and as ourselves, \"What happened to Duke Nukem after 3D but before Forever?\" Well, Duke Nukem had quite the journey from 3D to Forever. First was his console exclusive adventures (Planet of the Babes, Time to Kill, Zero Hour, to name a few) and a return to the second-dimension with 2006's Manhattan Project, it was clear Duke was still alive and kicking, but for how much longer? Duke Nukem Forever was still in semi-active development by this time, with no clear release date set (Again, \"When it's done.\"). Ultimately, Duke Nukem Forever was released in June of 2011, to middling and negative reviews.\nSo, where is Duke Nukem now? Making a cameo appearance in Bulletstorm, that other FPS with a protagonist who isn't Duke Nukem but may as well be Duke Nukem, albeit voiced by Steve Blum (Not Duke, not actual Duke). Will we see a Duke Nukem threequel? It's hard to say, but with the Michael Bay-helmed motion picture in active development (I'm not even joking here, there's a Duke Nukem -movie-), maybe the future is brigher for our steroid addicted action hero.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall, like mentioned in the header, Duke Nukem Forever's good bits amount to a game which is a solid six out of ten, but because of how spread out they are, between horrid vehicle sections, the strip club sequence and an uninteresting, I'd argue boring campaign, it makes sense to see how one could forget this game.", "hours": 18.4, "username": "TankCatapult", "products": 238, "early_access": false},

One of the more higher quality Doom clones that could actually claim the title of being as good as Doom. It has attitude, more realistic settings, a very risque sense of humor, absurdity all around, but the core game is also really good-- the levels are a bit more non-linear, each and every enemy has their own quirks and flaws, the soundtrack is great... the whole game is great, and is most definitely worth a shot, even today!\nThis specific remaster? It's... man,\nmuch potential was wasted here, I wouldn't blame you... hell, I'd even\nyou to seek down a big boxed copy of the original Duke Nukem 3D (preferably of the Atomic Edition variety) instead of getting this version. This is technically the second time I've bought this game, and boy oh boy, the first time I played this thing, it was f*cking\nThe sound was all muffled, the mouse acceleration was overly sensitive, it performed like crap (even though this originally ran on SOFTWARE RENDERING AND THE HARDWARE-ACCELERATED VESA VARIANT WAS ENTIRELY OPTIONAL, AND EVEN THAT ONE RAN ABOVE 60FPS), so I refunded it almost immediately.\nThis time, my cousin bought it for me for the New Years, a gesture I still appreciate, and believe me when I say this-- the problems I listed above? Most of them are (kinda sorta) resolved, the sound isn't muffled anymore for one thing, so some progress\nbe being made to do this game justice, but still... are you seriously going to buy this when a boxed copy of it exists probably for even cheaper prices, or you could just get your hands on a Steam key or something of the more content-filled Megaton Edition? The one that comes with a native Linux port and has all of the previous standalone expansions installed on it?\nLook, this remaster isn't\nbullcrap, so you could do a helluva lot worse. For one thing, it's not Duke Nukem Forever. (Seriously, I've seen footage of that game, and it makes me want to commit game end.) It's also more or less the original game we've all known and loved for years, largely untouched from its original variety. Hell, you could also consider the new episode, the eponymous World Tour a nice addition, alongside the VALVe-esque development commentary and re-recorded Duke talk by Jon St. John himself a pretty good bang for your buck...\n...but I'm not going to sugarcoat around, buster. If you want to play Duke Nukem 3D, this is\nthe optimal way to do it.\nIf you genuinely can't get your hands on the original game alongside its expansions, then I\nthis couldn't do much harm?

{"product_id": "434050", "page": 4, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-12-06", "text": "The first of the classic Build engine games. When Duke Nukem 3D came out it was a huge step forward technically from Doom and clones. Even 20 years later it feels fresh and innovative. From the items, to the great level design to the rockin' arsenal to the small details, there is much thought put into the game. And it really feels.\nThere were so many features and details that really made it stand out. Much of it is thanks to the Build engine of course and you can see similar details in Blood and Shadow Warrior. There are quite many destructible parts ingame, many walls can be blown up to reveal secrets or alternative routes, sometimes the ground will open up. It's not like in Red Faction where everything you see can be blown up but considering the year Duke came out, it was very fresh. Or footprints. If you have walked in muck your footprints will reflect that. Over water, your footprints will be watery blue. Over a corpse, bloody red. Shell and bullet casings spread around where you shoot. There are security cameras ingame which you can watch the feed of through monitors. This is actually really helpful since you can often see where ambushes are and plan ahead on how to approach. Or the feed will have visual clues where you should head next if you cannot find a key. I'll mention one of the weapons here too, the pipe bomb. Basically it's a remotely controlled bomb. You throw it, push a remote control button and boom. Simple. Effective. However, you can take it to another level with the aid of the cams and monitors. On one level with some space tram cars for instance you can see the enemies on the next station waiting for you to come over if you look in the monitor. It's an ambush clearly. So what do you? You throw in a pipe bomb into the tram car, send it over to the next station, head over to the monitor and when you see the car approach you click the button. Boom. And you get a live feed from the camera body parts flying and all. Ingenious. You can send pipe bombs through lifts. Even teleporters.\nDuke is actually one of very few first person shooters where the whole weaponry makes more or less sense, or you feel that every weapon has its specific purpose(s). You start with a handgun which might not be too useful, but it's a actually very accurate at distances and can be used on weaker foes to save ammo. Your melee weapon is actually a kick but you can also quick kick ingame items like trash cans, without the need to change the weapon you're holding, in hope to find some healing items or ammo. The shotgun feels just right, useful from close encounters to a moderate distance it actually feels quite realistic. The ripper chain gun is great for crowd control of lesser foes. Then you have a RPG which makes a quick mess of enemies. Useful for groups of enemies or stronger enemies to bosses it is a great versatile weapon. Then the pipe bomb which was already mentioned. There's also a shrink ray gun which literally shrinks enemies so you can stomp them to death! Hilarious. Devastator which fires smaller explosive missiles very rapidly. And a freeze gun which shoots freezing ice which can be used to freeze enemies into icicles. Then you can shatter them with a bullet or a kick. And lastly the laser tripwire mine which essentially is a trap. In single play its usage is quite limited unless you play on the hardest difficulty or you know where some enemies are coming from. In multiplay it's great fun. Put it over a teleporter for quick instakills.\nDuke himself is of course a parody over 80's action heroes and he shares a similar mentality. He throws bad one-liners all the time, some of them are quite funny. And he's attitude towards women, well let's say he's slightly sexist. It's not meant to be taken seriously. There are many hookers ingame and some alien abducted babes too. It doesn't really distract or add that much to the game though.\nThis package also includes two expansions. The expansions add one episode each, some new enemies and weapons. They are worth playing but are not quite up to the quality of the original episodes in my opinion.\nOverall, one of the great FPS games of the 90's. I had just as much fun replaying this as when I played it 20 years ago.

I've played it since the shareware version came out, so my view of it is slightly tinted by the nostalgic glasses I'm wearing as I get back to making these aliens pay for shooting up my ride.\nI reckon most people who read the reviews for the 20th Anniversary are familiar with DN3D already, so there's little reason to go over the basics, but just in case someone's new to Duke, it's one of the most important games in the FPS genre along with id Software games like Doom and Quake. Whereas early id games were serious and gloomy, Duke Nukem took a humoristic approach, filled with toilet humour and steroid-pumped action film hero one-liners. It was (and is) juvenile, tasteless and over the top. And it's great.\nThe initial release boasted three episodes with various settings. The first one takes place in Los Angeles, in the second you travel to space, while the third one is a hodge podge of unrelated locales. All episodes have tons of secrets to look for, ways to clear the levels fast by speedrunning, and the usual alien massacre. The game lends itself to different ways of gameplay, which boosts its replay value.\nThe fourth episode was released in the Atomic Edition, and is in my opinion the weakest of the bunch. It has a few new weapons, new enemies and interesting levels, but from the viewpoint of casual gaming, it suffers from hard to avoid damage and shortage of ammunition. It's still a very good Episode, but with a few tweaks it would be platinum.\nThat brings us neatly to the new additions of DN3D20thAV (rolls right off your tongue, doesn't it?). There's a new episode with new music, a new weapon, newly recorded lines by the original VA for Duke, Jon St. John, and a few new features.\nSince I already talked about the old maps, let's start with the new Episode: Alien World Order. It features 8 new maps in a variety of locations around the world and I'm glad to say they are all top notch from a level design point of view. They feel fresh but retain the old feel of the Build engine maps. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the levels are actually made by the original DN3D devs and map designers. There are tons of enemies and bosses in almost every level so they are not for the faint of heart, but they're not insurmountable even on higher difficulties. They give you plenty of ammonition and health pickups to deal with the swarm of aliens, and much like in the old days, there are secrets in abundance. And no, I did not find them all, despite humping almost every wall imaginable. The new music tracks for the levels are really good are composed by Lee Jackson, the main composer of the original game. And since we're talking about originals, the original voice actor for Duke not only has new lines for the new episode, but the old ones are redone as well. This may be a turn-off for some people, but you have to laud them for the effort.\nThe new weapon, the Incinerator, works as a counterpart to the Freezethrower, and as its name implies it burns enemies to a crisp. It works wonders on low-tier enemies, but even mid-tier baddies are not much of a hassle. Especially since they give you tons of ammo for it through-out the game. Honestly speaking, I didn't use it too much, but only because I love my Shotgun, RPG and Devastator way too much. It's still a cool addition and fits in like a glove.\nOne of the cool new features is the replay option. Whenever you die, you can rewind to any point of the level and continue on from there. It's a nifty tool that saves you time from saving and loading constantly, and gets you in the action quicker. In other words, you don't have to worry about not saving constantly. In fact, I only saved at the beginning of each stage and used the rewind whenever I got killed. Some might think it's cheap, but the fact the game allows you to save at any given time anyway it's just a handy way to continue playing without accessing the menu every time you make a mistake.\nObviously I like this game, but there are a few issues I need to address, however small they are. First, while the technical side of things is smooth, there is a slight deadzone for the mouse when you try to make small adjustments to your aim. This is not a huge problem, unless you play with the auto aim turned off - I did, and trying to make pinpoint movements was something of a hassle. Honestly, I recommend playing with the aim turned on. Trust me - it makes for a smoother gameplay experience and doesn't make you hate vertical aiming.\nSecond, some programs may result in crashes when starting up the game. I use Rivatuner Statistics Server to limit the FPS of certain games, and unless I turn it off, the game hangs at start-up and will not run. I can't speak for other software, but if you have trouble starting up the game, I suggest trying to turn off background programs.\nThird, the final boss fight was not so much a showdown that a letdown. After such a carefully crafted - and difficult - episode, I expected to face a real badass at the end. Unfortunately, I killed him without moving an inch and holding down the fire button. I don't know if something glitched out, but the new final boss is the easiest enemy of the game. That's a huge oversight.\nLastly, and this is not really a complaint but rather a preference: I would have liked to see the game sprites updated to voxels in the vein of Shadow Warrior. Having items that look more lifelike than the cardboard cut-outs we have now would've made the game look and play a little smoother. This probably would've taken more time than it was worth and I'm fine with how the game looks, but voxel sprites would've given the graphics that final touch.\nI recommend any FPS fans or Duke Nukem veterans to give this a go. Contrary to what Duke says at the beginning of the first new level, he's most certainly not too old for this♥♥♥♥♥♥", "hours": 19.4, "username": "[Zot] Wugga", "products": 303, "early_access": false},

I play a lot of games, good and bad, and would rank this as a good game(For adults).\nFor me it was definitely better than what some reviewers were saying, but I do agree that it could have been even better and I would have liked for it to be a more \"colorful\" and interesting experience, but I could still see the work that the devs put into the game and was impressed.\nFor 30 years I've been playing as many games as I can, so I see just how many bad games are out there, the ones that especially trigger me are those that ask for 60$ or more and turns out to be something I would probably program better alone.\nSo what I am getting at is that may help cause me to appreciate DNF since I really am comparing it to the mass amount of bad games on the market and know it is in a league higher than them for sure.\nSkipping ahead to recently, I was wondering if there were any new DN games, so I searched up Duke Nukem on Steam and seen that there was DLC for Duke Nukem Forever that I had never heard of, so I decided to buy the game again on PC and revisit it, and I am very glad that I did.\nNow, all that I say here has nothing to do with the DLC, I've not played it yet.\nDuke Nukem Forever is far better on PC and I am having fun with it all over again.\nIf you are into Duke Nukem, and you've only played this on console, I'd recommend you picking it up again on PC if the price is right since it feels like a different game and also feels more like classic DN3d with a mouse and keyboard.\n1 change that I wasn't enjoying so much with DNF was that Duke can only carry 2 weapons at a time now, but lately I found In options that there is an option to allow you to carry up to 4 weapons instead, I'd recommend you use it for fun's sake, but the game looks to have been balanced around the 2 weapon limit so it can become too easy carrying 4 weapons around, especially with the abundance of ammo in the game. Just make sure to not play on the easiest difficulty or it may ruin the experience for you.\nI think the developers did a good job and I have a lot of fun with all of the activities they've woven into the gameplay.\nMy favorite part of this game is probably how you can shrink things and be shrunk yourself, and it creates an entirely new world.\n1 problem I had with the game is that it feels too short. The game did have a Duke Nukem vibe to it, but the complete campaign felt like it should be 1 episode, with at least 1 more episodes to play with different sights and atmospheres.\nI was let down that I didn't get to take Duke to more areas, such as an amusement park, or a shopping mall, or a grocery store.\nI also like dark and creepy levels, Duke Nukem 3d spent a lot of time in nighttime, which is part of why I liked it so much, but DNF spends a lot of time in daytime which sets a different mood.\nI liked being able to control and use vehicles, but I have to comment that I didn't like the handling of the truck you can get in.\nI would have liked for the devs to improve the feel of that gameplay because I felt I was spending too much time in the truck, and with not fun handling it feels like a burden.\nDN3d captivated me from the enemies and weapons, I liked the look of them, and the colors, so I would say I was let down with the enemies and weapons of DNF because they were not capturing the same essence as the ones in DN3d.\nThey were all still good, and the pig cops often would startle me, but the point here is I wish they went in a slightly different direction, or more like at least stayed with the same direction.\nI have completed the main campaign again, and will start the DLC campaign after a break so I can feel refreshed for more DN.\nSo let me finish with saying that Duke Nukem Forever is a fun PC game, especially for veteran DN players, and I look forward to more games that I will still probably pick up on day 1 because DNF was not as bad a game as others have claimed and I enjoyed it.", "hours": 12.7, "username": "AndrewLevi228", "products": 37, "early_access": false},

There is NO OPTION TO TURN OFF VSYNC in the game's settings, relying on cheap Windows hacks or Linux environment variables (the latter of which do not consistently work, depending on desktop environment).\nThe mouse being barely controllable was a killer for me, in this game in which it's already hard to hit enemies when Duke runs at 30MPH, and the skill requirements of requiring accurate aiming or facing a swift and certain death of 90's shooters, I can not BELIEVE that the port was released in such a mess, and them removing the best edition of Duke to date from Steam, the Megaton edition, makes me sick.\nThese mouse issues are not a fault of my setup, other games, and eduke32, work perfectly.\nThis is on top of the fact that the Megaton Edition had (and still has for the ones of us lucky to own it, unfortunately I do not anymore due to deleting my old Steam account for personal reasons), had NATIVE LINUX SUPPORT, whereas Duke World Tour doesn't work on Linux without using a Windows compatibility layer such as Proton, or Wine.\nThe only positive thing I can say about this game is that it has Duke Nukem 3D's content, which can be used in eduke32 with a little effort by following THIS GUIDE:\nI heavily recommend, whether you are a Linux user or a Windows normie alike, that you do not play this release of the game. Either acquire Megaton somehow, or purchase floppies of the original game.\nAs I said, only buy this game if you can not play the original edition/megaton edition, and you are willing to follow the guide to make the data work in eduke32, this port is worthless standalone.", "hours": 0.6, "username": "Mommy Zoey~", "products": 99, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Knowing this, don't expect cool reactions from Duke Nukem fans like me.\nI won't be rating the awesome levels from the original game here, but just the additional content provided by this new edition.\nFirst of all, this edition has a few cool technical additions compared to the original game, such as lighting effects and the possibility to rewind the game upon death, but this is sadly shadowed by the technical defects and bugs it adds to the original game.\nDefects and bugs include :\nThis edition also features:\nNow for the levels. You have 7 (+1 secret) levels, taking place in various places of the world (\n), all of them made by the level designers from the original (1996) game. Sounds like a great promise! Well, not so great considering you're paying 10 extra bucks for losing 15-20 levels from the Megaton Edition and getting just 8 more.\nI've found the first 3 levels to be really nicely designed and rather faithful to the original level design from 1996. The 4th one, although not exactly in the same style as the original levels (\n), was OK as well.\nBut starting with the 5th level (\n), the new episode starts to feel like it was rushed so that Gearbox could release this new edition as soon as possible. The result is a set of messy levels that don't really feel like the original Duke Nukem 3D game.\nFor instance, the 5th level,\n, is rather linear (something seldom experienced in the original game) and contains a whole bunch of spelling mistakes and signs I don't understand (just what is\n– lit.\n– even supposed to mean !?), which, in my opinion, shows a lack of research prior to making the level.\nThe last level almost felt like an insult to Duke Nukem fans:\nOverall, the new levels are way too short and can be completed within a few hours.\nLast but not least, localization quality is poor, and you'll be far better off playing the game in english, rather than playing in your native language (this is what I've experienced with the french version).\nToo bad, because this new episode has some selling points :\nDon't buy this unless you find it on sale for like 5 bucks, and you don't know the original (awesome!)

I finished the old \"Duke 3D\" saga several times and wanted to tackle them from start to finish again with the release of the 20th anniversary title.\nSome history first...\nEven though Duke 3D is an old game, its source code was released years ago and allowed source ports to be created by the community. The most notable of which is EDuke32 and it's still the best one today.\nHowever, we didn't have an \"official\" one (aside from DOSBox) until some time ago. 3DRealms, while still retaining the rights, released Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition, a port that contained the original game, plus the Atomic Edition (fourth episode) and the official expansions - Duke Caribbean, Nuclear Winter and Duke it Out in DC.\nWhen those rights expired, the current franchise owner Gearbox released Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour after Megaton was removed. Sadly, copyright shenanigans or some such prevented it to ship with the the official expansions above (apart from Atomic). In their place, a brand new episode called Alien World Order was created with new enemies and weapons, in which Duke opens up a can of international whoop*ss on the alien scum.\nThe quality of the new episode shows in good looking new textures and sprites but a somewhat average level design, especially noticeable when compared to the incredible work from the fans nowadays (see the Roch series). Even though it can feel simplistic in its structure and pacing, the levels are on par with those of the older expansions, however.\nIt's great to have an official port and workshop for one of my favorite games, but it's a shame it doesn't have the older official expansions. On a less sad note, I still got Megaton in my library which I'll go through after I finish Duke 20th (no review will be possible, though).\nIf you're a huge Duke fan like me, this title is a solid \"canon\" entry to the classic series, but you may want to wait for a sale. What I do recommend again, though, are levels and mods created by the community which in fact have top notch design quality.\nBe sure to check WGRealms 2, The AMC TC, Starship Troopers and other top TCs (Total Conversions - one of the words that duke modders use) in the\ncommunity. Most of them use powerful features of the EDuke32 port. They can be found in sites such as\n,\n,\nand\n.\nDid you know that Duke Nukem Forever has an unofficial \"classic\" version made in EDuke32, based on content from the old trailers and announcements from way before the game was sold?

For I wished Steam would give us a maybe recommendation on a game like this. I personally think this game is like an 8.5/10 on my fan scale of being a classic Duke Nukem 3D game. Though it feels like a 7.5/10. There really could be more done with the game than what we already got 20 years ago. If you want to read me on a rant, that will be on the bottom of this review. Where I'll be putting out on why you should and shouldn't buy this game. Most reason being is, you're replaying the 4 chapters you played years ago. And now can play a 5th new chapter to the game. Which features it's own new gun, new levels, and a new boss. It also features small commentary and if you die in the game, a rewind back to a state before you die. Instead of reloading from a last safe state. There's also multiplayer for playing the levels on a co-op mode, or playing death match. If there's anyone who's there to play.\nPositives: Feels, functions, and plays just like the gane I remember 20 years ago. What more can I say? The game features full controller support. So you can play using a game pad if you don't want to use mouse and keys. The game features a level select too. So if you want to just skip ahead and play the last level of the chapters, go right ahead. At a cost of doing so, you'll only start off with your starting pistol and under powered from lack of weapons, items, and power ups. Not to mention, the secret levels are not selectable. You have to find them in the levels that take you to them. There is also a commentary of the guys from Gear Box talk about the game's production even back around 1996. There's only selective commentary on at least the 1st levels of each chapter and only features full commentary on the 5th chapter and all it's levels. So there'll be lack of replayablity if you plan to not hear it now and replay the game with commentary. Due to lack of it on 4 chapters and only on the 5th one. The graphics can now be filtered in and out of a true 3D background setting. So if you played the game in the past and want to see it what it would look like with better detail, you can do so with a push of a button/key. Just to compare to the past and present looks of the background. All the weapons are fun and add veriety to kill the enemies. Pumping them full of lead, using explosive weapons, shrink them down to size and stomp on them to death, setting up trip bombs, freezing them and kicking then down to shatter, expanding them to make them swell up and explode, and now burn them to a crisp with the new Incinerator weapon. A weapon redesign of the Freeze Thrower that would shoot out balls of ice to freeze enemies. This one lobs balls of napalm to the enemy in an arc. Once it lands on the ground, it will form a puddle of burning napalm. Enemies stepping on it or hit by it are burned to death. You traverse the maps from one end to the other. Finding keycards to open locked doors to progress. So you'll be back tracking to find them in certain rooms. There's also item pick ups you can find in the game that can be used  while you progress. The portible medkit that restores you back to 100% health while using a percentage out from it's 100%. Night vision googles in dark areas. And the most note worthy, the jetpack. You can fly up to high areas safely or you can't seem to reach from jumping or other means. There's a veriety of enemies to shoot down. Some are puny. Others can really hurt you or take a lot more fire power to take down. They added in a new enemy in the 5th chapter that will try to burn you to death. Depending on your difficullty level, will depend on how many enemies will be placed out on the map; Each end of the chapter has a boss battle against a powerful boss that will take a lot of fire power to take down, and they can try to kill you in one clear hit. If they're using rockets that shoot at your face. So straifing side to side is the only way to avoid rockets to the face, or find a moment to hide in cover to avoid more damage to yourself. The game also has a lot of secret rooms that lead to more health, ammo, and weapon pick ups. From blowing up certain cracks in the walls, to pressing the use button/space bar on certain walls or objects to open up secert rooms. A few you can walk right into the walls to find them. So if you're playing the game on a harder difficulty, be well in stock on ammo. Some certain game levels have a secret room that takes you to a secret level! So get the chance to find and play those hidden levels you can't select in the level select. The game does have a lot of classic/dated references of pop culture, to other video games or even movies. If you're aware of these references at a certain age, you should get them. Such as the DOOM Space Marine, Luke Skywalker, Indianna Jones, Terminator, and now Serious Sam in the new chapter. See if you can find them and notice them. Duke has been used to have a lot of pop culture references in his games, he's a reference of himself. A muscled out, big guy, size 13 boot wearing, cool looking, one lining, mo-fo guys want to be, and gals who want to be with back in the day!\nNegative: Now this I'm going to have a rant of it here. The reason why I'm saying not to buy the game is, there used to be the Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition. That includes the expansion chapters of Duke It Out In D.C. Where Duke fights aliens in Washington D.C. and to save the 42nd President. Nuclear Winter. Where Duke must back track 2 classic levels from the 1st chapter of the game, all covered in snow and Christmas themed enemies. Traveling to the North Pole to save Christmas. And my favorate, Life's A Beach. Duke is finally on vacation. Only to have it ruined by the aliens and pig cops once again. All weapons and pick ups are vacation themed. The pistol is reskinnded as a squirt gun. The RPG is skinned as a coconut cannon that shoots exploding coconuts. The pipebombs are skinned as pineapples that you toss and then trigger them to blow up. The Shrinker is reskinned as The Voodoo Ring. All weapons do the same thing. Just themed for the expansion. And health pickups replaced with banannas. And so on. Even the music on it is so catchy and familure to those who watched beach shows. These expansion chapters are not included in this game. For Gear Box didn't get the rights to claim them? Since they were made by different devs back then? I don't get it. But it feels like a bummer that they didn't. Have more levels to do. My guess is the only way they can add these is from the map editor you can use from people who can possibly port them over? Though, you won't have the reskins of LaB expansion. I need to mention that Jon Saint Jon, the voice of Duke Nukem, doesn't seem like he's really trying his best to be Duke. His voice sounds a little bit like he's just low energy and is just cashing in. Not putting a lot of effort for being the voice we all know and love. There was more energy and charisma Duke had way back in 1996-1998 than the recasting we have now. Come on! Litteraly act like you care! It feels off putting when I hear it today. The 5th chapter also features a lot of the bosses from the previous 3 chapters as mini bosses. So, prepare youself when on hgiher difficulty modes. Since they're challenging from before, they'll be challenging here. Another thing is the 5th chapter boss is just a reskin of the 3rd chapter boss. But in red and shoots out fire at you. The fire won't reach you. If you're far enough from him and just mow him down with explosives. Making it feel like a joke. The feature if you die in the game and can rewind to a timed state to prevent yourself from it happening again, makes the save slot feature feel slightly worthless. Somewhat negating instances of trail and error from reloading to a save state.\nAll in all, buy this game if you want to play the new chapater and levels.

Looking at it objectively, maybe that's true, but only because 2006 was a pretty bad year for FPS games.\nI was told mixed things ranging from \"it's awful\" to \"it's an underrated  gem\" to \"it's flawed but fun\"  The latter was the most common and made me think that I might enjoy this, I still play a lot of older shooters, DNF being dated is literally no problem for me.\nBut then I was shocked at how dire it actually is.\nThe visuals are often blurry and many levels are too dark to really see what the hell is going on.  Duke has night vision that you can activate at any time and is unlimited, but a lot of areas are too bright for night vision, and too dark to actually see.  I ran through the whole campaign without getting a jetpack, even though the control options menu mentions one.  Most weapons are absolutely useless, meaning that you'll be going through this with the shotgun, ripper and pipe bombs for hte most part, and then using RPGs on the bosses.  The game is a linear slog through boring levels that don't offer much in the way of exploration (compared to a lot of the open ended levels of Duke Nukem 3D) and the same 3 or 4 basic types of enemies swarm you at pre-determined action-setpieces.\nThe REAL issue though is how often you're not actually playing Duke Nukem.  A lot of times you're playing a bad version of Half Life 2, trying to solve physics puzzles.  Sometimes you're in a racing game, and sometimes you're shrunk down jumping across hamburger patties (yes, really). Sometimes, you're shrunk down AND driving a car, because why not?\nThe interface is godawful, even if it had been released in 2006, which it wasn't, and most mechanics are fairly useless.  The game is very easy, but you'll die in cheap ways a lot due to not being able to see what's going on, or just randomly at some parts.  I'm told the DLC is better than the actual game, but I think i'd rather uninstall it than continue playing.\nLastly, the humor is just not my cup of tea anymore.  Duke Nukem was funny to me when Duke3D came out and I was a teenager.  Now, it's just very cringe-worthy, and even over a decade after his last big game, he still repeats the same 15 or so lines over and over again.\nThere are a few exciting parts, such as the highway battle that cumulates in a second battlelord boss battle, where he stomps around and kicks the cars that you need to use as cover, forcing you to adapt.  The last level escaping a dam that is flooding and collapsing is fairly exciting and the last boss is well structured, even if it is super easy (the one time I died was friendly fire from the AI allies attacking from helicopters).  The ending is almost non-existant, teasing at a sequel that likely won't happen.\nIf you want to see for yourself how bad it is, the game is often on sale for very cheap (I got it for 5 bucks) but considering how many great games you can get at the same price during sales, you're best left looking elsewhere.", "hours": 9.1, "username": "NecroVMX", "products": 191, "early_access": false},

I know a lot of \"reviewers\" out there like to call this game a bad game. Most noticably soccor moms and SJWs who just want to hammer on it still to this day. I have to disagree on that. Still wished there was a mixed choice for Steam's reccomending choice. It's not awful. More like a flawed game. It's more than par to those who are fans to Duke since the 90s. It maintains it here since it was released in 2011. It's a 7.5309 on my fan scale. 7/10 to anyone who plays it just for the single player. Which is by far the only reason to play this game. There's more to do on there than the multiplayer. Since it's a FPS, 3rd person driving, platformer, puzzle, simulator mini game in a game game. The multiplayer is dead. I've played this game when I got it on 360. So I'll tell you some improvements from my last playthrough to this.\nPositives: It runs smooth for 60 FPS. The music is awesome to listen to in the background when you're shooting all the alien scum that's in your way. The game is a linier of get to point A to point B. Some bugs I've noticed have been patched out. Such as the Ripper machine gun reload animation is fixed. Texture pop in seems to be smoothed out now. Depending on your PC specs. The game removes the health and armor percentages for a more modren take of health called your \"Ego\" bar. You start off with 50% Ego. It reacharges when you're hiding in cover or when you're away from taking damage like any modren FPS out there today. To increase the maximum of it, you have to interact with certain objects in the world that Duke would find himself doing to increase his \"Ego.\" The health bar is a joke within itself. Which can be anything you can interact with by grabbing them, playing various mini games, and defeating the bosses in the SP campaign. It's nessasary to increase it. As the enemies will increase and playing on harder difficulties can be a pain in most modren FPSs. Such as increase damage on the player and the enemies become bullet sponges. So finding certian weapons in the game can help out with that. Some can be over powering than others. While others are weaksauce and you need to be creative on trying to deal them out. Using the environment like explosive barrels or flammable canisters can help out. You can even pick them up and throw them at enemies! Any ways to conserve some ammo and supplies. You can only hold 2 weapons in the game. And all the classic weapons from DN3D are in this game. Plus the alien weapons you can now use. So choose wisely on what weapons you're going to use in the game. You can also carry around the classic pipebombs and the laser trip bomb that can not only be stuck on walls, but now on enemies. Some supplies from the classic DN3D game come back. The HoloDuke has been improved to make Duke invisible while a hologram of Duke fools the enemies for a short time. The steroids come back, but have more of a different effect. It will reduce Duke's Ego to 75% max, but in return, reduce damage taken from enemies slightly. Causing him to go in a roid rage and his melee punches will one hit death enemies in a single punch for a short time. The night vision goggles are replaced with \"Duke vision.\" Which it used to see in dark areas. They added a new item that is the beer. Which one can can make Duke go in a druken state. Reduicing damage taken by enemies by a lot, but makes your vision blurry and hearing slowed down. Like being drunk for real. There's also a mix up of the action with puzzle/platforming. Trying to get one end to the other. You even have to get from one end to the other by shrinking yourself down to the size of a 12\" doll. Kinda cool to see what size difference is when you're small. Not to mention Duke stays true with his witty one liners. And like the past Duke games, there's plenty of Easter Eggs pop culture references from other games and some movies. Only to those who may have played the games or watched the movies. So they might not age too well like any other game. Still welcoming to hear them. There is also turrent sections that have nice action to the game. There is also a driving section to get from one place to the other. While crashing enemies with your monster truck. The game does have some cheats you can use and turn on and off. However, doing so will turn off any achivements to get from the game in that playthrough. The enemy AI is alright. They'll attack you and will take cover as well.\nNegative: I have to warm you this is a Mature game for a reason. If you're someone who takes offense immediatly for seeing women only naked with their top exposed, crude sexual jokes, and can't find humor of being a person escaping from real life to something that is fun, then please by all means, don't buy this game.  The bosses can be a mix of a little simple to beat, to a difficulty spike of killing you almost every single time if your timing is off. Causing you to restart from your last checkpoint over and over again. So trying to map out the boss patterns or the overwhelming enemy minons that will keep on spawning to slow you down on progression. Only explosive weapons can damage the big bosses. So weapon choices can be limited to them.When you finish the bosses off, you then have to walk up to them and do a quick time event (QTE.)  A few of the mini games can feel somewhat underwhelming and might not been play tested. So getting your Ego max can be a pain to others to those who want to be complitionists. The loading screen doesn't take long for those who say it does. It's much shorter load time on PC than on the console ports. Faster on today's good PCs now. The story is somewhat subpar. Could of been a bit better. You might end up at a point if you don't have enough suppliies or the right weapons for the harder parts of the game, you'll have to make due on what you got and try to huff it out with cover tactics and have the weapons you can find. Thought it won't be a problem on boss fights. Since they provide the weapons and ammo crates to restock on beating them. Since you can't carry 50 RPG rounds like in the last game. You can only use 5 rockets at a time. Try drivng segments in the game feel a little bit dead without any music to play in the background. Could of sounded a bit lively with some tunes on the radio maybe? The multiplayer is dead. So don't bother with it. Unless you have some friends to play to level up to unlock stuff for your \"My Digs\" area. Which unlocks stuff you can mess around with in the area and unlock some of the mini games you could play from the single player game.\nAll and all, if you're a fan of Duke Nukem, you play this game. If you're not, at least try it out for the single player story mode. Which is just a mix of crude humor, killing aliens, saving the babes, and laugh out loud fun. But if you're someone who's afraid of naked women and find this game to be the worst? I have nothing to say to you and move on to something else better. I had fun with this game. Hope all yinz do the same.\nX3", "hours": 34.3, "user_id": "76561198123409605", "username": "Rylkal The Wolf 🐺", "products": 492, "early_access": false},

{"product_id": "434050", "page": 11, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-08-24", "text": "I rate the game Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour 4/5. While generally very good (and you do not need to run DOS box or anything like that to get this game working), this 20th Anniversary edition would have been truly excellent if it had included all (or at least most) of the various other major add-ons and other content which has come out over the years (Including but not limited to: Lame Duke, Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach, Duke it Out in D.C., Duke: Nuclear Winter, Duke Nukem's Penthouse Paradise, Duke Xtreme, Duke It's Zero Hour, and Platoon just to name a few) instead of attempting to appease fans with only a single new episode (Alien World Order) in addition to the four previous official episodes (LA Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse, Shrapnel City and The Birth).\nThe new episode, Alien World Order, is still fairly good (with some mildly confusing level design here and there) though.With the minor graphical upgrades and the major control updates (it is now perfectly easy to control your movement and aim using the now standard mouse/keyboard configuration), Duke Nukem 3D has aged extremely well despite its now silly looking sprite-based 2 dimensional enemies.\nThe sound effects remain pretty good (especially those nice booming, echoing explosions) and the re-made Duke Nukem dialogue is at least adequate. The enemy AI isn't that bright but the level design and basic enemy design and enemy placement within the levels is pure genius, even (or especially) when compared to modern games, especially all the fairly linear ones which have come and gone since Duke Nukem 3D first came out. The level design is truly clever, often squeezing tons of action into fairly confined layouts without usually feeling cramped (unless the game wants you to feel cramped) and often forcing you into some still fairly unique tactical situations.\nWhile Duke Nukem 3D is a fairly linear game, it is not unusual for the levels themselves have multiple paths to reach an objective (usually a switch or a keycard to unlock a door). Also, as in the original versions of Duke Nukem 3D, every single level doubles (and often works fairly well) as a multi-player map and the hardest difficulty 'Damn I'm Good' functions as a hard difficulty intended for cooperative gameplay through the single player game wherein most of the enemies will come back to life a few seconds after you kill them. You can also play against computer controlled bots but their AI is extremely rudimentary and unlike in Unreal Tournament, playing against bots gets boring fast.\nStill, the various multiplayer features (cooperative and player versus player) cause the replay possibilities to be quite impressive, especially compared to many other modern single-player oriented games. Duke Nukem 3D was clearly famous for a reason. It's a shame that you pretty much have to plan to play this game with someone you know as there are never any active rooms in the multiplayer lobby. Not very many people are still playing this game. It would have been really cool to have the option to do a Borderlands style \"open\" playing mode wherein random people could jump into your game and interact with you (hopefully cooperatively) on the extreme off-chance that someone does happen to be playing at the same time you are, but sadly this feature is not present.\nThe game's music is probably the Anniversary Edition's weakest point. While the music is a passable imitation of what an average-to-good sound card could have done with midi files at the time Duke Nukem 3D originally came out, the music could have been made to be far better. On Youtube I have heard re-mastered and re-orchestrated versions of every single one of Duke Nukem 3D's songs from all 4 original episodes which blow every single song in this Anniversary Edition completely out of the water (I'm not sure what's happened but most of the remastered song versions I'm referring to have been taken down from Youtube since the time I was listening to them a couple years ago). However, the versions of the songs included with this game are simply mediocre and their general lack of high quality seems lazy. Duke Nukem 3D has some musically excellent songs. Including classic versions of songs would have been okay but there should have been an option to turn on totally remastered music and help give some of the better Youtube musicians some official recognition in the process (whevever they are now, if they could be found).\nTo conclude, Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour is currently the preeminent version of this game which you can buy. It is good, works fairly well and has fairly few bugs and good, modern FPS controls. You do not need DOS box or any other hokey retro-ware to make this game run. It runs like any other normal Steam game. It runs at my monitor's native resolution of 1920 by 1080 with no problems and did not look distorted either. It's brightness seemed neither too dark nor too bright. The developer commentary is only present on certain, specific levels and is not particularly detailed though (a definite let-down).\nUnfortunately, this Anniversary Edition is also currently the ONLY version you can buy. It's good but it has a lot of room to grow. It BEGS for additional DLC content in the form of all the various old add-ons that have existed. The old Megaton Edition had the first four episodes (but not the new Alien World Order episode but it did have a whole bunch of the various old add-ons that are now no longer available. The removal of the Megaton edition and replacement of that version with this altogether smaller, more limited version has understandably angered a LOT of fans and has mildly frustrated myself. I really love how well this version works but I hate how woefully incomplete this version is in terms of content. The people who play this game 20 years after it came out are usually going to be the biggest fans. It would be an obviously good idea to give them as much content as possible, even if the price ends up being quite a bit higher.", "hours": 11.9, "user_id": "76561198075673573", "username": "wrygrass", "products": 450, "early_access": false},

Even with LIGHT RESEARCH, you can plainly see that Duke is abut a copius amound of guns and violence. It would have also been easy to include some fans in the testing phase. If the fan testers saw regen-ing health, limited guns, and severely linear maps, they would have cried foul.\nA personal gripe I have is how they handled Duke's attitude. Duke Nukem is supposed to be a blatent hedonist; he likes smokes, beer, guns, and beautiful women. When 3DRealms handled this, they showed it in moderate amounts that the player ran into via the places and people Duke encountered. In this installment, it kinda seemed less like presenting a known fact to the player and more like they were trying to shove \"SEX! SEX! SEX!\" down the player's throat. This is demeaning to everyone; we're not walking-talking genetalia, people.\nAlthough I never got to this game mode (and probably never will), I also found the \"Capture the Babe\" mode a stupid take on Capture the Flag. It's kind of pointless and uncomfortable.\nI did get some enjoyment out of this game, but not nearly enough to justify the cost at the time I bought it. If you think it's your cup of tea/coffee/can of beer, go ahead and try it.

There is also the option in the menu to use the old Duke voices if desired in case you aren't a fan of the new ones for whatever reason there may be which is also nice.\nThe graphics enhancements are also a nice addition to the 20th anniversary and look pretty nice.  I myself disabled these graphical effects so I could enjoy the retro look while playing and also just to point out you are not forced to have the new look and can play with the old-skool look if desired.\nSome complain about the audio being of low-quality.  I purchased the game while knowing there are Youtube comparisons between this and the Megaton version and a side-by-side comparison makes this very apparent, but... When I loaded up and was expecting this low-quality disappointment I was greeted with decent sound as I played and did not sound anywhere near as bad as what it seemed from internet videos and reviews.  I suppose it is also possible that the devs may have improved this prior to my downloading it recently.  Even if not and you haven't purchased it yet, THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT ACTUALLY BAD!\nSome complain about the mouse.  All I am going to say to these folks unless this bug was again fixed by the devs prior to my aquiring this version of the game... I don't know what they are or were talking about.  I had no problems with mouse control and it felt just as good as it did in Megaton edition.\nThe only complaint I can give to the 20th anniversary edition is at times there are buttons, switches and keycard activators that will require you to find the \"sweet spot\" before the use reticle will activate it.  I don't know what causes this, but it does not happen often.  When it does, I just align the crosshair slightly over buttons and press the quick kick to activate the button or switch.  When it happens with the keycard doors and elevators it is really annoying because you can spend a whole minute moving forward, back, sideways and turning while repeatedly hitting the use button before it finally responds.\nOther than the aforementioned issue the entire game runs well, doesn't have any crashes (that I know of), stays true to the original, adds an extra episode (Alien World Order) as a bonus, takes up less than 500MB for a game with enhancements and extras and is fully enjoyable to play.\nOne other thing I almost forgot to mention which I really enjoyed was the snapshot save feature this version has.  If you are playing for a while and find yourself dead and haven't saved for a while, don't worry because this game saves your progress every so many seconds while you are playing and you can return to any previous point of the level you were at before with all your exact progress at that point even if you didn't manually save.  HOWEVER, do be sure to make a manual save BEFORE YOU QUIT as this feature only works while you are playing and the game is running.  Extremely cool, nevertheless!\nIt was even more worth the sale as I discovered especially since I grabbed my copy while it was on sale.  Definitely worth the purchase!  Despite what others are complaining about with the sound and mouse, at least as of late June of 2018 from whence I purchased it, these two things can be ignored and the game is well worth it!", "hours": 22.5, "user_id": "76561197971735798", "username": "slayer366", "products": 125, "early_access": false},

Players take control of Duke as he navigate through a series of levels which take place on Earth. The game allows players to interact with various in-game objects, including urinals, water coolers and whiteboards which allow players to draw their own images. The gameplay is similar in some respects to the first-person shooter games of the past, with each level culminating in a boss battle in which Nukem has to fight and kill Battlelords.\nUnlike in the previous games, Nukem can only hold two weapons at any one time in a manner similar to the Halo franchise, although Pipe Bombs and laser tripwires are considered inventory items and as such are not limited by this restriction. Items that have an effect on Nukem can be picked up by the player; these items consist of are steroids, beer, and a Holoduke. Steroids increase the strength of Nukem's melee attacks by a great deal for a certain time. Beer makes Duke much more resistant to damage, but blurs the screen. A holoduke creates a hologram of Duke Nukem that looks and acts in a very similar way to Duke, but often says slightly different versions of his one-liners. While the holoduke is in effect, Nukem becomes invisible and the AI characters do not recognize his presence. The Jetpack also returns, but only in multiplayer.\nInstead of the health system featured in the previous Duke Nukem game, in which health would be depleted when Nukem was injured and would only increase upon finding a health pack, drinking water from fountains/broken fire hydrants or using the portable medkit special item, Duke Nukem Forever employs a system involving an \"ego bar\" similar to Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project. The ego bar depletes when Nukem is attacked; once it is fully depleted, Nukem is susceptible to damage. If the player avoids further damage the ego bar is restored, as is Nukem's health. The player can increase the size of the ego bar (thus increasing the amount of damage Nukem can take) by interacting with certain items throughout the game (for example, a mirror), and by defeating bosses. The game employs a saving system that is solely based on checkpoints.\n●Stable Frame Rate\n●Decent Shooting Mechanics\n●Various Online Modes\n●Reasonable Amount Of Content\n●Outdated Storyline\n●Bland,Boring Visuals\n●Poorly Imitates \"Valve\" Inspired Physics Based Puzzles\n●Frustratingly Long Platforming Sequences\n●Dead Multiplayer\nPlaying the previous installments of the franchise sets a pinnacle for this game, but almost everything about this game makes the previous much older games look comparatively superior and puts a nail in its own coffin. As the game slowly progresses it fells like it is just going down-hill and downgrading on fun. Duke Nukem Forever gives u the plan boring vibe which sometimes becomes downright untolerable. It doesn't polish on a single gameplay mechanic which makes it feel slightly unfinished, I personally can't recomend this game less there are various much better alternatives out there.", "hours": 45.3, "user_id": "76561198379490128", "username": "卩ㄚ尺ㄖ丂尺卩乇几ㄒ", "products": 147, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Alright, listen... there some things in this world that just bad and sadly this edition of Duke is one of those things but why am i thinking like that you may ask? Well let's find out shall we?\nLet's start from performance: it's bad and it's bad because of one thing: V-sync wich means that your FPS will be captured at 60 and it's also breaks the mouse movement (more about that later). And this wouldn't be a problem if you could turn it off but Gearbox thought it will be a great idea to disable this feature. (You can't even disable it using NVIDIA panel).\nControls: The main problem with controls is the mouse - it's just feels stiff, heavy and really awkward. Plus sensitivity for X and Y are different for some reason. (Probably because this edition was mainly made for consoles).\nLack of content compare to Megaton Edition: one of the biggest selling points was a new episode. While this episode actually really good and have some of the most beautiful level designs i've ever seen in Duke it's still not enough. I mean look at Megaton Edition it had three big addon. I've heard that this edition don't have GNU/Linux and macOS support but previously mentioned Megaton Edition had it so... take notes i guess.\nSecond selling point of this edition was \"True 3D Rendering\". It's looks cool but before this and previous editions came out fans already made this for free using Eduke32 source port in 2007 or 2010 ! And in my opinion fan's version looks way better than the one we have here. It sad to see that developers can't make better or at least same job as fans do.\nAll i can say is DON'T buy this game.(I'm not suggesting you to buy it even on sales) If you want to play some good old Duke buy original DOS-BOX version of the game on GOG or any other site and use Eduke32 source port. Or you can try and find a copy of Megaton Edition.\nAlright before you call me out for bad English let me say that i know about that.

Featuring the original four campaign episodes, a full multiplayer “Dukematch” fragging-contest mode, an optional lighting and environmental rendering upgrade (which, incidentally, looks amazing), and a whole new level pack from original designers, titans of the industry, Allen Blum III and Richard “Levelord” Gray who also provide an all-new, in-depth commentary track to the maps which will surely pique the interest of any oldschool Duke fanboy.\nThe singleplayer combat feels just like it was back in 96’ – movement is fast and fluid, with top-speed run-and-gun feeling so refreshing after the recent industry standards of grindy shoot-and-loot and wall-cover mechanics burdening the player who might rather be using their own ability and shooter intuition to navigate alien-strewn levels instead. The basic story of the super-macho protagonist repelling a hostile space-alien invasion is an effective framing device to transpose the gun fun into a myriad of settings, starting out your roaring rampage in an earthquake-prone Los Angles wherein you acquire a private arsenal of guns, explosives, and fantastic space-age weaponry to turn on the invading hordes of lizardmen, terrifying giant flying Lovecraftian octopuses, literal mutated pig-cop enforcers and hulking behemoths of level bosses.\nFor all the nine-thousand pounds of weaponry and ammo on your person at any given time the game surprisingly manages to add an impressive amount of variety to the whole affair with much of the game’s second chapter taking place on occupied space stations and lunar bases before a massive bossfight on the alien command ship. During this chapter’s eleven hugely sprawling and atmospherically tense levels, Duke becomes the lone hero in a completely hostile environment, faced with unfamiliar locales and much more directly powerful enemies, you can take to crawling through airvents and looking for hidden circuitous routes from which you can make effective use of sneaky guerrilla tactics involving freeze-, and shrink rays, triggerbombs and tripwire mines to thin the alien ranks before a direct confrontation, especially on the harder of the game’s four difficulties, wherein a “Battlelord Overseer” might make mincemeat of you the second you open the wrong door.\nThe game continues past this point with another episode evidently designed with the philosophy of pushing absolutely every aspect of the 3D Realms Build Engine, with colossal fights with whole enemy armies amidst towering cityscapes all filled with explorable interiors and filled with secret pathways to the level exit. The original three campaign episodes round out with larger and larger onslaughts against the alien menace before a fittingly apocalyptic showdown in an arena brimming with weapons to use against the “Cycloid Emperor” himself.\nHowever, this proves to be only a new beginning for the Duke as he can now traverse another level pack which originally debuted in the surprisingly obscure ‘Plutonium PAK’ expansion, which returned the series to the more horror-esque environments seen throughout the series which more challenging levels and the introduction to the strongest enemies to be seen in the franchise. That was, more or less, as far as Duke Nukem entered the sphere of gaming for some time with only a few re-skinned level packs from out-of-house developers and a tonne of generally sub-par fanmade shovelware packs before the long-awaited 2011 sequel was unfortunately panned by critics, received poorly commercially, and seriously destabilised the brand.\nThis re-release may however signal a change however, as the brand-new eight level episode exclusive to the 20th Anniversary displays the passion that the original designers-developers have for their creation decades later. Completely backed up with original talent including an all new soundtrack and dynamic score from composer Lee Jackson and the true voice of Duke, Jon St. John. Good things are finally coming back to this iconic series.\nOnce you’ve played through the story to your heart’s content, try out one of the multiplayer modes which have all been revamped especially for this release. Available in co-op mode for a team-based approach to levels so you and up to seven friends can speed through maps leaving a trail of alien bodies in your wake. Or, for those seeking a competitive twist to the classic formula, try out the “Dukematch” deathmatch mode to see which of an array of inexplicably re-coloured Duke clones can score the most frags against one another in a predetermined time limit, or who can reach a preselected amount of kills first. Either way Dukematch (which can be slayed solo with a team of highly competent bots solo) is some of the most-intense, highest-octane, fast-paced fun shooter gameplay I’ve ever seen, and it’s definitely something more games these days would be better off taking some pointers from.\n\nThis game isn’t for everyone, it’s known for having a purposefully “immature” sense of humour, and while there’s nothing wrong with that inherently, it will put people off, and the risqué portrayal of the game’s iconic scantily-clad women has raised some eyebrows and stirred up controversy in the past, while the best blood and gore sprites MS-DOS could provide are now almost campily quaint, this is still a decidedly adult game. Nevertheless, if you can pick this up around sale time like I did, running through the levels old and new while listening to the previously-unheard developer’s commentary and sweeping up a light and breezy roster of Steam Achievements is a great activity for anyone still chomping at that nostalgia bit.\nHeartily recommended.", "hours": 27.9, "username": "SevenSixTwoZeroSeven", "products": 133, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Why? Simply because it is a completely different generation as far as gaming goes, people are less concerned about having a blast and more concerned about bogus realism with duck and cover mechanics that requires you to be more careful. Duke manages to emulate this sort of thing pretty well but that's the problem, fans want the old Duke but the developers always wanna go with what's popular at the time so they can make more money. The questions developers have to ask themselves are often pretty tough, money ultimately drives everything and when choosing to stay in the past as opposed to moving forward with the rest of the crowd you run the risk of being like nintendo and told you're the same game, while on the other hand emulating the present leads to being labeled a copy cat and doing something different all together is seen as too risky. Bury this game in the pile of garbage and remind Randy Pitchford to Pitch this game into the garbage can in his head and make it so he can never empty it so that he'll always have to live with the thought of this long hallway of a game in his head.\nYou're gonna need some balls of zeal to deal with these halls of steel. Steel piercing through your brain that results in a headache as you think to yourself, \"what were they thinking?!\" Halls of steel that bore you and will make you question your sanity as the game feels like one long, boring chore, of just shoot, cover, run, and jump. This game is a long hallway that just changes appearance while Duke gives some funny one-liners and forced memes. One might even say the \"Forever\" part of this game is the long hallway you feel like you're walking through while playing it. I would move the files of this game onto a disk just to then torture the disk and throw it in the toilet, this game starts out with you in the bathroom, almost as if it's self-aware that this game is boring as s*** Duke's latest adventure feels like a pile of dook and in an effort to profit off of a massively successful franchise from the 90s the developers felt the need to copy every other shooter while still giving the comedic over the top feel of Duke.

The graphics play more true to the orignal version with nice little upgrades in the lighting and tone. I own all four versions of this game from the orignal Playstation (BEST! Save for the almost unforgivable frame drop on the very last boss battle...). Duke Nukem emulated HD pack which is surprisingly very good as the characters are actually made into 3-D models that play well, save careful... the default graphics don't work as you blindly try to work through the game's scrambled graphics to the graphic settings. Tricky but do-able. But that's besides the point, you are not looking to get that game\nNow the pointless comparison of Megaton version to this 20th Anniversary addition. World Tour version wins on the simple note it stays more true to the orignal game than the other. Megaton's 2.5 sprites looked better and sharper but flatter?!? And actually sofened up too much as they loose details to the fuzzing... blurring? But the most important thing? They BOTH kept the EXACT same gameplay of the orignal Playstation version! Minor graphic flaw? Easily forgivable but World Tour kept to the orignal 2.5 sprites and the details popped for it.\nMegaton version should win for having all the levels that were developed with Duke Nukem 3-D Atomic Addition. World Tour said 'Forget it, those level were bad anyhow.' and they were right but to put the nail into the coffin, they developed their own custom set of levels with some of the orignal creators. Nothing too flashy but it will feel like some of the orignal levels that made Duke Nukem 3-D tyhe hit it still is today!\nStill though I wished they would of left the option of letting their gamers decide on which version they would of perfered because they would be making more sales as I couldn't decide until I owned both. World Tour nudged out but I was happly with the Megaton Addition too.\nAs with all games, especially multiple clones of one overpopular version... each has their own strengths and weakness but this latest remake of an overkill classic... Done perfectly for me but it's earlier versions, good enough that I was perfectly satified with them too.\nRecommend this game? If you were ever a Duke Nukem fan, then the answer is obvious.

The cheesy one-liners, the 80's action movie references, the alien♥♥♥♥♥kicking, the level design, HNNG it's so great.\nBut how does the 20th Anniversary World Tour hold up?\nWell, it has a brand new 5th episode called \"Alien World Order\", which has Duke traveling around the world stopping the alien bastards from invading other parts of the world, and includes a new originally scrapped enemy called the Firefly, which really does have a pretty cool design. The enemy may seem like a burden to kill at first, but one simply rocket in their faces and they're all gone.\nThe episode itself is... Good, the final boss is just a disappointing reskin of the Cycloid Emperor, and some levels fall flat here and there. But Mirage Barage, Golden Carnage, and High Times have to be the best levels in the entire episode. The new weapon, The Incinerator is nice. But again, you can tell it's just a reskin of the Freezethrower and Expander.\nIt includes a new rewind feature that was only available in the XBLA version of Duke3D, and developer commentary, which you activate in-game with mic icons, similar to Valve's developer commentary in Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and 2.\nThe rewind is a nice feature if you're a lazy POS like me and just wanna play the game, and the developer commentary is okay. But considering the fact that you can hear the developers playing the game while talking, I would rather have videos of them playing the game as a unlockable feature to be honest.\nAnd the new recorded lines by John St. John are... Alright, some lines sound better then the originals, while some lack the aggression, the frustration, the grit, and the Clint Eastwood vibe that Duke had in some of his lines. That's what made him badass to begin with, and considering there's a interview with John that has him doing exactly that, I think either the voice direction just sucked♥♥♥♥♥ or John wasn't paid enough, or they just let him do it his way because after all, he IS Duke Nukem.\nThe True3D... That's a major improvement, big time. The new lighting is great.\nAnyways, and now onto the only things that suck about World Tour...\nNone of the expansions are included, and the multiplayer needs to be fixed.\nI REALLY hope that Gearbox can add the Expansions later as DLC at a reasonable price, but at least Duke it out in D.C. is available for free on the workshop. I don't care if they don't add Duke: Nuclear Winter, since it is kinda crap, but the novelity is nice to own. But seriously, this is what made Megaton Edition so great. You get the main game PLUS the expansions for a reasonable price, but for World Tour the new episode is the reason why the game is priced 20 dollars alone, which is a ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous move on Randy Pitchford's and Gearbox's part\nThe sound for everything but Duke's new lines sucked♥♥♥♥♥and sounded awful, but luckily it was fixed before I got this, so this con can be thrown out the window.\nThe multiplayer is dead for this game, mostly because of the servers crashing every five minutes. I never got to try it out myself, so... I wouldn't know, personally.\nDuke Nukem 3D is an amazing 10/10 game, and World Tour is pretty good 8/10. I recommend this wholeheartly for people who never got to experience the awesomeness that was Duke3D, but for fans, I recommend getting this when it's on-sale.", "hours": 8.9, "username": "Tritnew", "products": 45, "early_access": false},

If you can put aside the 13 year development cycle (and all the baggage that's associated with that), \"Duke Nukem Forever\" really isn't terrible. It's not great by any stretch, but its playable.\nI can put aside the dated pop-culture references, the virtually non-existant plot, and the \"ok\" gunplay. What Duke really suffers from is a lack of identity (and load times/short levels). At its core, it really does feel like a succesor to Duke 3D. You can see Duke 3D's influences through out, whether it be by level location, weapons, one-liners, or paper thin plot. But digging a bit deeper, this game clearly had an identity crisis durring development; whether it be through abrupt tone changes, weird and sometimes poorly designed physics puzzles, or bizzare \"mini-game\" sections.\nAll that said, if you are a fan of Duke Nukem and you're willing to let go of the \"controversy\" surrounding its development, I would reccomend you pick this up when its on sale. As of the writing of this, I would hesitate to say it's worth $20 at this point.

So let's dig in.\nThere's this notion that the design of 90s shooters is outdated and that praise of them is largely propped up by nostalgia. However, for me I can say that is definitely not the case. I didn't play Duke 3D in the 90s, or even the 00s. It wasn't until 2010 that I played it for the first time, and I can say that it absolutely held up.\nDuke 3D is a massive callback to pop culture, with an abundance of references to everything from Star Wars and Die Hard to Doom and cult classics like They Live. Duke himself is a charismatic one-liner spewing badass straight out of a cheesy 80s action movie. The whole game has this unique sense of fun, wit and charm about it that makes it great to come back to, whether it's taking down pig cops and other alien slime, or kicking♥♥♥♥♥in a burger joint, a supermarket or an amusement park. The everyday locations combined with an otherworldly menace really go well.\nThe gameplay is of course solid. The Build engine brings fast and frantic 90s action with some new additions like an inventory where you can store items like jetpacks and portable medkits. The gunplay is satifying, giving Duke the kickass arsenal you'd expect from him, including a powerful rocket launcher and a shrink ray that shrinks enemies and lets you squash them.\nWith that out of the way, what's new in 20th Anniversary? Well, you have the new campaign by some of the original level designers, a rewind function, and developer commentary. The new campaign is alright, although there are some major missteps like the final boss being a joke, and a truly bizarre new enemy that I don't think meshes well. I never used the rewind function as I'm used to quicksaves, but it seems to work as advertised. The dev commentary consists of Valve-style icons that you walk up to and activate. They are included in old episodes as well, but only in certain levels.\nThe big thing that sucks about this edition though is that you don't get the expansion packs (Duke it Out in DC, Nuclear Winter, Life's a Beach). Sadly only the Megaton Edition has these, and it's no longer for sale (officially).\nOverall, if you're new to Duke 3D or maybe are only familiar with the abysmal failure that was Duke Nukem Forever, definitely get it. If you've played Duke 3D already, get this depending on how big of a fan you are, whether you feel it's worth the cost ($20 is steep for one episode) and how you feel about Gearbox/Randy Pitchford.", "hours": 9.6, "username": "atro city", "products": 2649, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false},

When it came out it just didn't look very exciting, and it generally got bad reviews so I stayed away. But being a Duke fan I knew I had to play it eventually, and now that it's dirt cheap and we don't get that many single player shooters anymore, the time is right. And well... it's your typical 2000-2010 era scripted linear shooter with action set pieces, easy environmental puzzles and multi part boss fights. It's painfully by the numbers in that respect, and for some reason 1/3 of the game is literally an arcade driving game.\nSo why the recommendation? It's short enough where the level design doesn't get tedious (just bare through the slow start and boring mid game strip club sequence), most of the time it's actually interesting to see what they will throw at you next. There are also some highlights that rise above the mediocrity, like when Duke gets shrunk which exhibit some very clever level design. Shooting aliens also generally feels good, and I thought the new versions of the Duke 3D classic enemies like Pig Cops were well recreated. If you also like Duke 3D as a character like me you'll probably get kick out of the voice lines too, I genuinely laughed a few times.\n\nSo in conclusion stay away if you are looking for an original FPS, well written story or characters, or expect a Duke 3D sequel that actually plays like Duke 3D, because this isn't it. But if you are good with a linear, short single player fps experience where you get to blow up some aliens and listen to Duke say funny dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll have fun.", "hours": 15.1, "user_id": "76561197972278132", "username": "Zapmaster", "products": 63, "early_access": false},

{"product_id": "434050", "page": 19, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-04-01", "text": "When it comes to first person shooters, the most groundbreaking games in the genre undoubtedly came out during the 90's. This time period was truly the golden age for the genre, releasing a ton of classics in the genre that laid the groundwork for much of today's titles in the genre. Wolfenstein 3D started it all but then we got titles like Doom, Rise Of The Triad, Blake Stone and eventually a game would come out that really carved its own unique place among other so-called \"Doom clones\". With its groundbreaking engine, impressive amount of interactivity and one-liner spouting titular action star protagonist, Duke Nukem 3D managed to create quite a few ripples in the gaming community despite the incoming Quake which would make its technology look a generation behind in comparison.\nI practically grew up with Duke Nukem so the character holds a very special place in my heart. The very first game I remember ever playing was the very first Duke Nukem, an EGA platformer for DOS that was a really popular shareware title around '91. Already then Duke Nukem was established as a gun-toting badass who was Earth's only hope. In the first game he went after the evil Dr Proton and his army of Techbots, and while his personality was a bit derivative and referencing pop culture like watching Opera Winfrey show, it wasn't until Duke 3D his personality as a woman-loving pill-popping ultra-macho amalgation of 80's action heroes came into play. And in a way, Duke grew up with me. When Duke 3D came out I was about 8 years old and just about to enter my teens and with Duke 1 being my first game, it felt as if the character had grown up with me. I was always interested in a lot of typical boy stuff at that age, watching a lot of movies that I wasn't allowed to, playing games I wasn't allowed to and generally showing more and more of an interest in the kind of masculine entertainment that there was a lot of when I grew up. And a lot of it really influenced my tastes and shaped me to be the person I am today. I of course also liked feminine stuff, I hung out with other girls a lot, played with dolls and did all of that stuff, but I was also into guns and shooters and such things, and always have been. And something about the Duke Nukem games almost embodies all of those core interests. There's a dystopian and almost cyberpunk future feel to the games, and this carried on very well into Duke 3D although it has a distinctly more realistic feel than the first two games.\nThe story is pretty simple. After returning to Earth after defeating the aliens in Duke 2, Duke finds that another alien race has wiped out most of Earth's population and taken most of our women, and turned all the police into pigs. His mission becomes to wipe out most of the aliens on Earth and take the fight to their mothership in space, culminating with a battle with the one-eyed commander of the entire fleet and the alien queen in a bonus episode called The Birth.The story never takes itself seriously, with Duke at one point saying he'll♥♥♥♥♥♥down a boss' neck after killing him. And promptly does so. So yeah, it's not a huge story or anything but it's funny, works for setting the game's derivative tone and there's nothing really bad I can say about it.\nMost of the gameplay revolves around grabbing keycards, much like in Doom, and reaching the end of the level. Interestingly a lot of the levels seem connected as you may seem parts of an upcoming level near the end of the current level and so forth, a concept that further evolved into the level structure of games like Half-Life. You also have babes scattered around a lot of the levels (particurarily the alien environments) who are trapped in vines. You can choose to mercy kill these poor women, though doing so will provoke the enemies and spawn in additional reinforcements. Of course, killing babes that are NOT trapped is NEVER okay and the game will punish you for this by spawning in enemies.\nThe most fun part of Duke 3D is the interactivity though and it's what truly set the game apart from its contemporaries at the time. You could blow up parts of the level (indicated by cracks in the textures), you could drink from fountains, use toilets, break toilets, drink from said broken toilets, play pool, oogle women, oogle yourself, you get the point. This helped a lot in making the game world feel real and believable in addition to the realistic level design. It was also one of the first games to rely somewhat on scripted events (something that would be greatly expanded upon in other Build games), with parts of the levels being restructured in a pretty impressive fashion, a great example being when Duke blows up a building in a level and climbs into the ruins, or creates and earthquake in another level to reveal more of the level. This kind of interactivity in the levels made the game feel much more alive and explosive than something like Doom and even Quake.\nThe game featured some pretty nifty lighting for its time, featuring light switches that could dynamically light up an area and coloured lighting that directly affected the player's sprite and everything around it. The developers really made sure to push as much as they could out of the engine and it shows. The screenshots in this review are from the latest version of the game which is the 20th Anniversary World Tour edition and it's probably the best looking version of the game so far.\nSound-wise the game presents some pretty cool MIDI tracks (in modern source ports like the aforementioned World Tour edition these have been remastered as ogg files) that have more of a rock feel to them than Doom did. None of the tracks aside from the main theme can really be called memorable though and most fall into the category of being pretty much background music. And of course, Jon St. Jon's portrayal of Duke is now legendary with the game's many one-liners being classic quotes even today, so not a single bad word about his performance. Although his re-recorded lines in the World Tour edition does lack a bit of their original punch. The weapons all sound really cool, ranging from the beefy shotgun and peppering chaingun to the satisfying explosion sounds makes the game a joy for the ears.\nSo a question remains, which version of Duke 3D should you get? Well, at the moment there is only a single version available and that is the World Tour edition. It comes with re-recorded lines from the Duke himself, improved graphics, as well as some rather lazy developer commentary (and most of it coming from Randy Pitchford himself, who isn't exactly popular among Duke fans nowadays), but for the most part is kind of lacking as it does not include the 3 expansions Duke It Out In DC, Nuclear Winter and Duke Carribbean: Life's A Beach. It does however include a new fourth episode which is worth playing. The earlier Megaton Edition did include these expansions and multiplayer but lacked some polish, especially on consoles, and the original DOS version was included as part of 3D Realms' Anthology pack but this pack has since been discontinued as well as the Megaton Edition, since Gearbox claims to own the IP and won't allow 3D Realms to release any of the original Duke Nukem games (which is highly ironic considering 3D Realms gave birth to the franchise...). So that's a kind of sad affair altogether. However due to how well the game has sold it's not hard finding physical copies online on places like eBay (which is where I bought my own boxed copy) and most of these physical copies work fine with DOSBox so however you obtain the game, it's definitely worth playing, cause even 22 years later, Duke Nukem 3D is still one of the most badass shooters in existence. I mean, it may seem a bit dated today but when this game came out, there was simply nothing like it.", "hours": 19.3, "username": "λꞁꭚꭗꭗ", "products": 642, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false},

Duke Nukem is a badass ruthless alien-killer, and when his planet is invaded by space aliens, he goes through the city and kills them all, one by one. This game is 3D realm's take on the popular first person shooter, Doom, which captivated the world with its violent, but innovative first person gameplay. The thing I like about this game in particular is how it took the first person aspect and innovated it even further. In Doom, the player had the inability to jump or to look up and down from viewpoint; 3D realm would rectify that in their game. Duke can run, jump, look around his surroundings, and punch in a few one liners (which by the way, are quotes from various movies). The enemies themselves are all so well-designed, they don't look like typical bald-headed aliens you'd see in Roswell, or something; they look very menacing. The game features three Episode, all set in different locations. In Episode I, you fight the aliens in the city of L.A. In Episode II, you go into space through different stations and bases. Episode III is where you're back on earth and you fight the aliens in various locations. If you own the Atomic edition, you get an extra episode where you fight an Alien Queen. Now Since, this is the 20th Anniversary Edition, the game also features the option to play the game with inhanced HD graphics as well as a new fifth episode, where Duke goes on a world tour, so to say.

{"product_id": "434050", "page": 20, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-03-21", "text": "Includes the original three episodes, the fourth \"The Birth\" episode that started being included with Duke3D releases starting with Atomic, and an all new fifth episode exclusive to this package that was made by the original developers. This new episode also includes new music by the original composer, a new enemy and a new weapon. What's missing compared to previous packages are the three licensed expansions: Duke it Out in D.C., Life's A Beach, and Nuclear Winter. It also doesn't include the N64 or PS1 versions of Duke Nukem 3D, but no bundled release has done this yet (though the since cancelled Android collection was planned to include these and be the first truly definitive version - with the major downside of it only being available on Android). This collection is also missing the shovelware unofficial and unlicensed map pack collections, but those were extremely low quality and I only bring it up to mention they aren't here.\nThis release also includes a developer commentary mode which, when enabled, puts hovering interactive voice files all over the game that can be used to get more insight into the history of Duke Nukem, as well as some insights into the development of this release. There is also a \"Playback\" mode that can be enabled or disabled. When enabled, this allows you to rewind to any earlier section in your playthrough on that mission, so if you don't want to need to spam saves throughout every mission, or routinely forget to save and end up losing progress, you'll want to leave this on. It's worth noting this game doesn't autosave, not even when starting a new mission, so you will still want to make hardsaves.\nHas some pretty brutal input lag which is caused by vsync, which can't be disabled in-game. You can however disable vsync by forcing vsync off through your GPU's control panel. Once you fix the input lag issues, this version controls the best as far as official releases are concerned, however the mouse control still doesn't feel as tight as what can be experienced playing the original in eduke32. It isn't reading the input as well for some reason. The Megaton version that has since been pulled from Steam had worse mouse input issues of its own that never got resolved. It also used an OpenGL renderer, as opposed to putting the game in a new true 3D engine, which is what this version does. You can turn on SSAO, and you can also switch between the classic and new engine with the press of the \"C\" key. The immediate difference is that the FoV has been corrected, and there are more light sources in addition to an improved lighting engine to make the game world look less flat. The improved lighting is nice visually, but also has the side effect of removing some of the game's tension, since a few areas that were once dark are now clearly lit.\nI didn't play this version at launch, but have read that this release used to use different sounds than the original. That must have been addressed, because ever since I've been playing this, it sounds the same as the original. The sound effects and music don't seem to have as much depth as they could though. Duke's lines have been re-recorded with the same voice actor to get more audio depth to the old recordings - as well as having some new lines - but if you don't like the way the new lines sound, you can turn on the \"Legacy Duke Talk\" option, which lets you use the original tracks.  Some of the sound effects (mainly the alien noises) still have a lot of distortion to them, it was this way in the original as well so it's hard to tell if this was intentional for an effect or audio clipping that occurred and they never went back to fix it.  Either way it's really obnoxious and should have been fixed for this release, although it would have required re-recording those sound effects to be properly addressed.\nHas an integrated game browser for coop and deathmatch multiplayer support, up to 8 players in both cases. I've never been able to find a game, so can't comment on multiplayer beyond the mention. It does allow for you to do offline vs bots (no coop with a bot however), but that gets boring fast.\nThis is a classic 90s shooter. You don't regenerate health, and starting with the \"Let's Rock\" difficulty you'll need to find at least some secrets in order to keep from regularly running out of ammo, and if you want to go above that, you'll likely want to be playing with a guide to ensure you get every possible pickup along the way. \"Damn I'm Good\" is Duke3D's version of Doom's \"Nightmare\" mode where enemies respawn, so the difficulty I would recommend playing on if you want a game that gets your pulse going without getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥shoved in for not being a master of the maps is \"Come Get Some\". \"Let's Rock\" is a little on the easy side. I want to say the levels start off simple and become increasingly mazelike as the game wears on because it's true, except that even the early levels can no longer be considered \"simple\" by modern standards. The vast majority of levels are non-linear. Most of the levels are fun to explore, but there are going to be times where you'll feel incredibly frustrated because you've been running around in circles and can't figure out exactly what to do next. Thankfully in this day and age that can be alleviated by alt-tabbing to a browser (or bringing up the same through a Steam overlay) and quickly discovering what your next move should be, but it is still worth noting that the 90s map design can be a little too obtuse for its own good at times. For the most part, the open maps are a lot of fun to play. They will just take you more time to get through than most modern shooters because there is a lot more to chew through in each mission.\nThe main issue with the missions that end up getting frustrating is that it's hard to see the switches you need to press to cause something to change in the level to allow you to proceed.  They end up blending in with the textures on the wall, it's been that way since the original and has been this way in every official release since.  There's an HD mod that addresses this, although it dramatically changes the rest of the art style and whether or not this is a positive is going to be up to personal taste.  Although purists may say it would be wrong period to have any sort of change to the original assets, I do think the gameplay could have been significantly improved in this release if they had done something to make those switches stand out more against the general textures they are sprayed upon.  In most cases this could have easily been solved by making the switches a higher resolution than the rest of the assets, and while this would conflict with the rest of the game's presentation, could have been something to toggle on and off through the menu as an ease-of-use option.  I would gladly play with it on if it were available, just because the main reason I ever got lost in Duke3D was due to having no clear path forward, and the way to generating that path being accessed by finding and activating one of these unintentionally far-too-well hidden switches that blend in with the textures.  Again you can just google to figure this out most of the time, but a simple change like this would have made that unnecessary and saved a lot of frustration.\nI recommend this because despite missing the three licensed (but unofficial) expansions, the mouse input not being as good as has been seen in Duke ports in unofficial engines (though still very playable once vsync is forced off), and several sound effects still having distortion/audio clipping issues, this is the best official collection that has ever been available. If all these issues were fixed, this would easily be a 9/10.  If they had done all this and also included bug-free, hi-res, multiplayer supported versions of the N64 and PS1 takes on Duke3D, making this the truly definitive all inclusive \"World Tour\" version of Duke Nukem 3D, this would be a perfect 10.  As it is, it's an 8.", "hours": 11.7, "user_id": "76561197966385727", "username": "Evilnapkin", "products": 516, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

The new episode is a worthy addition and you can feel it has that nukem vibe to it. There are a good amount of new things added to the game, and the level designers tried hard to make something new. There are a few bugs but I've only noticed minor things. If anything, you can load the game to any point of the episode with the new feature added. Sadly the multiplayer seems dead or at least there wasn't anyone playing when I tried to access it. The new episode is about 4 hours of gameplay without replay, but like all episodes it does have a high replay value. I couldn't find half the secrets most of the time. I found it a bit disappointing that the new episode didn't include any cutscenes and there wasn't much of a story, when previously you'd have Duke trapped in a cell losing his weapons or a end-boss kickass cutscene. I think the new episode isn't the best episode, but I'm happy the guys came together to remaster the game. The commentary is a great addition, tho sometimes its a bit hard to activate the triggers.\nImportant to note that the new lighting is a huge hit on performance, seems like it's not well optimised.

It looks even better than the Megaton version although you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference unless you're looking at a comparison or you've played the old game for countless hours.\nWhat's awesome is that the original level designers came in and made a whole new episode( 8 levels) and each one is a real treat. They're really, really good and apparently would have been impossible to make and run on the original engine. There was a lot of work put into this new episode. I personally found it to not be that hard on the \"Come Get Some\" difficulty like I've heard of other reviewers complain about, but maybe that's because I play so much Duke that I'm used to it. Its got tons of boss enemies in level which I personally have a huge hard on for. I love nothing more than firing away on those large and detailed 2D monsters for what seems like hours until they die.\nThere's even this really neat commentary feature where, when turned on you have these speakers that you walk up to and if activated will trigger an audio clip of them talking about making that specific part of the map. It's really, really a lot more interesting than it may sound.\nThey even give you the option to choose whether you want to listen to the original Duke dialogue or a new version re-recorded by Jon St. John. Not that he's the biggest chatterbox but as a big voice acting nerd I eat this stuff up. There's a new soundtrack for the new levels and it's pretty bada** as well.\nThere's some other features like a reskinned version of a different gun made to be a flamethrower. It's moderately fun to use I suppose. Now when you die you have this unique rewind bar where you can rewind back to any spot you want. I suppose it's alright.\nNow what I don't really care for is how, after Duke's right's were tossed back and forth they ended up in the hands of Gearbox. Now I like Gearbox, but they've done some stuff with the Duke property I really don't care for. Mainly not letting a small indie company release an AMAZING full 3D Duke game(the story is complicated but that's the gist) and deleting the Megaton version of Duke 3D off of steam which included all of the original expansions which I hear are hard to find and are extremely expensive to buy the original versions of(luckily I bought the Megaton Edition long before its deletion). And this World Tour version does not have any of those expansions. Who knows perhaps they'll be DLC later on.\nAll in all it's worth buying without a doubt. It's got the original classic game with The Birth thrown in, it's got the cool level designer commentary, and it's got an 8 level pack made by those original designers that I think is worth the price of admission alone.

The Megaton Edition isn’t available on steam anymore and it’s been replaced with the 20th Anniversary World Edition, which includes a never before released campaign from the original designers and audio commentary, both of which are quite enjoyable. I wish more 90s games released audio commentary with a re-release. Allows players to get a feel for how the game was designed and where a lot of those weird references come from.\nThe game is still excellent. I’m not sure why people are complaining this is a horrible port. It’s a fine port. And all the content from the Megatron Edition is included in this game.\nI can understand why some people got upset over the re-recorded voice work. This is equivalent to people who dislike the Star Wars Special Edition, and want the ORIGINAL work from the ORIGINAL game. That’s understandable, but if you’ve never played the ORIGINAL game you won’t even notice.\nThere even a new weapon introduced, the flamethrower, which you can use in the new episode which takes you to London, Paris and Moscow. Pay close attention to those levels and turn on the audio commentary if you can. You’ll learn some interesting facts about the design of those levels.", "hours": 6.7, "username": "Dukefrukem", "products": 1047, "early_access": false},

Consequently, I returned the game.\nAlso, this version of Duke 3D lacks the 3 extra episodes that are in the Megaton edition, 2 of which contain some of the most fun to be had from Duke 3D episodes.\nOf what I played from the new episode in World Tour before returning it, the new levels don't contain the same type of flow as the original Duke 3D episodes, and are more liner, with large enemy dumps to progressively clear out of each next area. So, I found the new episode's style to be less engaging.\nI think that Megaton is still by far the best Duke 3D release, and that it's a tragedy that it was removed and replaced by World Tour.

This is NOT another \"modern\", front-loaded game that shoots all of its bullets in the first quarter of the game. This game shows its true beauty over the course of the campaign. Much of the greatest stuff only comes after the second hour.\nThat said, it has its downsides. These are the things you should consider before buying it:\n- Don't have high expectations because the predecessor was a seminal game. This one is not. It's still a pretty good game.\n- Also, don't have high expectations because it took forever to be developed. That doesn't mean all those years went into actual full time development. Also, don't expect it to be like the 2001 trailer.\n- the graphics are a little basic. But in 4k in 2018, it's still quite beautiful. Some areas have a Doom 3 feel to them. And the game doesn't have any post-processing effects - so you can see every model and texture rather clearly. Personally, I wish more games would still used that style.\n- also, probably due to technical constraints, the game is essentially a series of mini-levels. It feels like a bunch of short stories, each with their own little plot. Some of these mini-levels are more puzzle focused (non are hard), some jump n run, some shooter, some action-sequence and some have a weird idea at their center.\n- again, it is not front-loaded. The best mini-levels come after the first 2-3 hours. Also, the \"The doctor who cloned me\" dlc is pretty good.\n- it's very scripted. That's not equally obvious in all levels. There are also a lot of nice larger fighting arenas - but they too tend to come in the second half of the game.\nSo if you'd like a reminder of the good old shooter days, with some modern elements to it (no medkits) and are willing to give this game some time to win your heart, you might just enjoy this.", "hours": 23.6, "username": "InfoSoph", "products": 964, "early_access": false},

I've played them both and I feel that the 20th Anniversary World Tour is the better of the two and here's why.\n1.  The World Tour version doesn't come with the Duke it out in DC, Life's a Beach and Nuclear WInter expansions or map packs or whatever they are.  I've played those three map packs and didn't like any of them as they didn't seem to fit with the Original Duke Nukem 3D.  The new maps are sort of interesting when looked at thematically as a whole, but overall they are boring.  The individual maps are huge. which sounds great, but it sucks because it takes freaking forever to cross them even at a run and there is nothing really interesting to see.  So they are  long, boring and tedious.  I was happy not to see them in the World Tour version and especially liked that I didn't have to play them for achievements.\n2.  The World Tour version comes with creator commentary that you can turn on in the options.  When turned on, you get floating icons throughout many of the maps that you can activate.  When activated you get audio recordings from a couple of the original creators of Duke Nukem.  It was super cool to hear their thoughts and such concerning the making of Duke Nukem 3D.  Their commentary ranged from in-game jokes and pop culture references used in the game to reasons or thoughts as to certain creative decisions to coding or visual techniques that they used in the map making process that were actually quite difficult but look so simple and could easily be taken for granted nowadays.  I found the technical commentary to be very insightful.  Hell, I found almost every piece of audio commentary very interesting.\nThe commentary in the game easily made the purchase of this version of Duke Nukem worth the price I paid.\n3.  The third and final thing that made this a superior version was the new episode built by the original creators who did the commentary for this edition.  It was easily one of the better episodes and \"expansion.\"  The maps easily looked like something made by the Duke creators.  The new episode had the same feel as the original Duke Episodes even though they were able to use newer lighting techniques and improved visual assets, most of the Maps were super creative.  The first and final maps especially stood out to me, but all of the maps in the new episode are great.\nThe World Tour version of Duke didn't appear to have OpenGL rendering.  While many people may have liked that in the Megaton Edition, I was fine with it not being in the 20th Anniversary World Tour Edition.  There was a setting for improved graphics and I thought it was quite good.  It keeps the pixelated style graphics, but used smaller boxes/polygons so that it looked close to OpenGL rendering, but wasn't and I actually preferred it as it felt more like the original Duke than the OpenGL rendering did.\nProbably the best feature was the \"rewind\" ability.  While you could make save files during a level just like you always could, which is useful if you are going to exit the game midlevel, the rewind ability was great assuming you started the level without leaving the game in the middle of the level.  The game records the player's progression through the level so that if at any point you were to die, a rewind function appears on the screen that allows the player to back up to any point in the level or something before the death and allows the player to try a different strategy,  The player can backup even to the beginning of the level.\nThe rewind function was pretty awesome since there were swaths of time where I would forget to save the game and end up dead.  The rewind ability just allowed me to backup 10 or 20 seconds (or more) and redo the section without dying.  There was even a couple of times I actually ran into an Easter Egg where Duke would say something, but I couldn't hear it because I was listening to one of the creator commentary tracks, so I would pull out my rocket launcher and kill myself.\nThe rewind ability popped and I would back up a bit and continue.  The game recordng would also note I was listening to audo track so the track would continue playing where I backed up to; I'd let the commentary finish and then walk up to the Easter Egg so I could hear Duke's Joke.  Super Cool!\nThe only annoying thing about the 20th Anniversary World Tour was when I was playing the game in Full Screen, if I Alt-Tabbed out of the game, the game would automatically disable Full Screen mode go into windowed mode.  Once I was done with whatever I was doing outside Duke Nukem, the only way to get back to full screen was that I had to go back into VIdeo Options inside the game and turn full screen back on.  Once Fullscreen mode was back I had to wait 5 seconds or so because a few of the buttons (e.g. Action e key) wouldn't work.  After the 5 seconds everything was back to normal.\nNot too bad, but could get annoying.  But don't Alt-Tab out and you never run into an issue.\nDuke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour was a lot a fun and worth the price, in my opinion.", "hours": 18.9, "user_id": "76561197967876062", "username": "TopperHarley", "products": 210, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false},

If you like Duke Nukem 3D you should like World Tour.\nThe thing is some parts of the world are missing from ‘World Tour’. It doesn’t include the expansions: Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach, Duke it Out of D.C or Nuclear Winter.\nI doubt these will ever be added (officially). And if so it would likely be as paid dlc.\nThe game does include one extra episode Alien World Order.\nWhich takes you to Amsterdam, Mosow, London, Egypt, Paris, the Golden Gate Bridge San Francisco and then the Hollywood sign.\nThese new levels look nice with a lot of details. But the enemy placements arent so good. There are a bunch of mini-bosses for no reason. Exploration in these levels aren’t so good either.\nThere is a new weapon the Incinerator. It can be very satisfying when you’re able to hit an enemy with it.\nThere are new enemies Firefly Trooper. They are able to shrink themselves which make them annoying to hit.

So he uses this short range flamethrower thinking he can hit me from a distance which he cant. Makes him very easy to kill.\nThere is also Steam Workshop.\nThere is a rewind feature which is good, so when you die you can just rewind a bit.

And had more content.  World Tour has a lot of aliasing (jaggies). The new recorded lines for Duke sound awful at times.

{"product_id": "434050", "page": 24, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-12-09", "text": "What can I really say about Duke Nukem that hasn't been said before? 20 years of extraterrestrial butt-kicking, curvaceous babes and cheesy one-liners from a 'roided out protagonist who is the very definition of machismo. Seems like it all flew by in an instant, eh? I've loved DN3D since I downloaded the shareware version when I was still a precocious lad who was probably too young to be playing a game with such mature themes. I would whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys prime 90's first person shooters. Great controls, innovative level design, big powerful guns that feel great to use against the numerous foes you encounter. Everything you want in an action game is here.\nIf you don't already own it, stop reading right now and buy the damn thing. You won't regret it!\nFor those of us who've been playing for the last couple decades? This particular rerelease, while very good in its own right, isn't completely essential if you already own the game multiple times on multiple systems. There is so much that this latest iteration does right, yet there are certain cons offsetting the pros that make me hesitate to say that it's the definitive version, Despite the minor nitpicks, if you're a hardcore fan of the series, there is enough new content to make it worth your time if you can get it at a good price.\nThe main draw and reason to purchase this version even if already own the game in another format is the brand new 5th episode, \"Alien World Order\". This provides 8 new levels set in various locales around the world, designed by Allen Blum III and Richard 'Levelord' Gray, who both worked on the original game. I found all but one of these levels to be very fun and a great compliment to the existing 4 episodes. While they are technically more advanced from a design perspective in some ways, they still have that great old school 3D Realms feel and blend in nicely.\nBesides simply getting new levels, this new episode includes additional dialogue for Duke Nukem. Jon St. John returns as the voice of The Duke, with plenty of fresh and funny one-liners. He also did retakes of all his classic lines in a higher sound quality than was possible in a `96 MS-DOS game, so it matches seamlessly between the old and new. I was glad to also see an option included that reverts to his original lo-fi performance if you're a purist. I tend to favour the rerecording for the improved sample rate and consistency, but it's worth pointing out that Jon St. John's inflection and emphasis on words is slightly different in places. Try both versions and see which you prefer.\nThe last of the new content comes in the form of the \"Firefly\" enemy and it's associated flamethrower weapon. Some of you will recognise both of these from early screenshots taken during the development process, yet neither made it into the original retail game or the Plutonium Pak. Their inclusion for the 20th Anniversary was a great way to honour the history of the series, while simultaneously giving us something we had not previously experienced in-game before. While I think it would've been interesting to reintroduce even more cut content from the beta versions, this new 5th episode already delivers a great \"never before seen\" Duke experience just the way it is.\nWhile the new episode is definitely worth playing; there are a couple gripes I have about the overall presentation of the old content. The menu system is streamlined and works well, yet I miss seeing the logo exploding onto the iconic box art when the program starts. I also felt that the gamma correction could've been a little more flexible. I play most of my games using a projector and even with \"brightness\" set to highest level, certain areas are still too dark. The in-game text also now uses a stencil font instead of the classic fonts from either v1.3d or the Atomic Edition.\nThe most glaring issue lies with the audio. Certain sound effects like the chaingun cannon firing are very harsh and have too much treble. Others, like the ambient sound of the alien spaceship in E1L5 \"The Abyss\", were entirely too bass heavy and were abusing my subwoofer. Music has been mastered at a very inconsistent volume with some tracks being so low that they are almost inaudible and others being overpowering at times. Fortunately, the renderings of the classic MIDI songs themselves are quite good, sounding similar to how they would on a Roland SC-55. For someone with decent audio software and a knowledge of modifying Duke 3D; these issues can be corrected and I have done this to my installation, but most people are not that hands-on.\nMy final point of contention is that while the new episode is indeed enjoyable, there is a bunch of content and levels from previous releases that were not included in this 20th Anniversary package. Unfortunately it does not include the levels from officially sanctioned add-ons such as \"Duke it Out in D.C.\", \"Life's a Beach\" and \"Nuclear Winter\". We also do not get the episode \"Plug 'N' Pray\" from the PlayStation 1 release, but that is obviously much less of an issue since that was never originally released to PC.\nOverall, it's still Duke and it's still great. Despite already owning the game many times over on various computers and consoles, this is the version I probably play the most. Hopefully my review has given players who are familiar with past releases of the game some insight into whether it’s worth an upgrade, or if it would actually be a slight downgrade from the version they’re already happy with. Despite the few issues that I detailed in this port; Duke 3D is a true classic that has stood the test of time better than most. See you all in another 20 years for the 40th Anniversary Holoduke Edition!", "hours": 46.4, "user_id": "76561197977957168", "username": "Dehumanizer", "products": 37, "early_access": false},

Somewhere near the end my safe file corrupted and I could not bring myself to start it over again until 6 years later.\nNow, with an unbiased mind, I actually really enjoyed this game! Is it a good \"Duke Nukem game\"? No, it doesn't capture the essence of the classics but those were different times too and things from back then wouldn't translate well into nowadays. The amount of things to do, mechanics and minigames is astounding and none of the mechanics like the monster truck or shrunken parts overextend their stay.\nSomething that could annoy others, which rather impressed me, is the amount of detail that went into lighting, in a lot of areas the game is just dark enough for you to need to use Duke Vision to fight properly and seconds later need to switch it off because a light source just came into play to blind you with DV on.\nUnfortunately it plays like your run-off-the-mill FPS game from 2011, 2 weapons, regenerating health, guns feeling really flat. Would have rather had the option to hold way more different weapons with a lot more ammo like in the old games to mix it up more often (at least the game provides fixed spawns of different weapons constantly)\nMaybe enable the option that lets you hold more than 2 weapons. I didn't enable it, it was fine, but running out of ammo was a bit of a problem as not all enemies drop their weapons for ammo and a few weapons having abyssmally low ammo capacity. The character was obviously supposed to be the strong suit of this game, so if you're not into toilet humor and such things you probably won't enjoy.", "hours": 21.4, "user_id": "76561198036842942", "username": "MegaHellstrike", "products": 136, "early_access": false},

Indestructible confidence with a nonchalant persona that considers allies and humiliates enemies, with some chuckles for all, for or against you. Dukes presence was missed: I played the game three times more to remember Duke Nukem than to experience the average fps content, in a way this relic of the past points out the flaws of the “emo” super heroes and heroines of todays standard. Just like Doomguy from the Doom series, Duke Nukem doesnt just get the job done, he starts the fricken party.\nWhile DNF got alot of smack talk when it came out, the hype for it  was worse than the game itself. DNF was good overall, Id rate it for an fps game about 6 /10, its an average fps game with nothing great but nothing bad. I like games where Im shooting aliens, and mutants, and creatures other than humans, and DNF gives you that, aliens, octabrains, pig cops, pregnators, and more – also an interactive environment to play around with but you dont waste all day fussing with every item on the desk (Prey).\nDNF represents the Duke universe well, it has many interactive items you can fidget with and use like throwing items playing casino slot machines etc – and it doesnt break the pace of the game.\nAfter two playthroughs the linear levels can get boring, the interactive items sought after for achievements are usually passed up and what made the first playthrough so fun is now  known and fleshed out. The variety of weapons is fun, the added option in the menu to make a 4 weapon inventory helps, try it once with the 2 slots and you'll find it wasnt that bad as people talked about on debut.\nI did not have any performance or graphic problem on the main game or dlc. The multiplayer as of April 2018 had 4 server at prime time evevings USA and nobody was playing. The MP has enough maps and a few different modes to get you through the challenges and upgrade your character and mansion, but people have to be playing. The multiplayer is nothing special.\nDuke Nukem Forever on sale is a deal, expect 7-8 hour of gameplay value and some incentive to revist it a few times, the dlc is worth it at sale price also.

(I gotta say, a thing this simple adds a lot to the fun and immersion).\n- Out of the box controller support\n- Megaton is unavaible to purchase.\nDuke3D is an old game per sé and unless you're a die hard fan, I don't feel the price is justified compared to what you got in the Megaton edition (which was at half price); that said, when at a sale, I highly recommend it to people like me, that got late to the party and want to own a registered version of Duke 3D.\nYou might or might not consider it inferior, but this is still a good version, I like the new Duke Talk, I like that it supports a controller out of the box, I like the time rewind feature, I'm having more fun with this than the Megaton edition (I wanted to own Megaton, but it was already unavaible when I decided to give Duke3D a try). I heard people saying the new sound is lower quality and the new Duke Talk just doesn't sound like him, but I think they're fine, I actually prefer the new Duke (which of course is always voiced by John St John). The True3D, which is a mode you can toggle even in game, is very neat, at first I liked it a lot, but I realized that it does this weird zoom, especially when you watch up and down near walls, and it gives me a headache, so now I play mostly with it turned off.\nYou have your workshop, which you had in Megaton as well, your multiplayer, but since this edition can only grow and the other you can't find a legit copy (except grey markets, which are not totally legit and are going to finish stock at some point) I would go with this one.\nSpeaking of workshop, a guy is releasing the levels of Duke it out in D.C., one of the expansions that was missing from this version, so that's very neat, kudos to you mister! Maybe we'll see the other expansions as well, I surely hope so.\nAs far as the exclusive fifth episode goes, I haven't played it yet, but the general consensus seems to be that it's nothing to write home about.\nAll in all, I got it at 66% discount, and you know what? I don't regret buying it, I like it and I'm having fun, so it's a thumbs up for me, come get some!\nI even nominated it for the \" The “Cry Havoc And Let Slip The Dogs Of War” Award\", because I feel like a badass playing as Duke kicking alien butt.", "hours": 31.7, "username": "Raiseo Hitsu", "products": 1074, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

{"product_id": "434050", "page": 26, "page_order": 3, "recommended": false, "date": "2017-11-27", "text": "EDIT: I rebought this title once it went on a -75% sale as the new episode is really awesome, but this doesn't change anything I had written before - I still consider this to be an unpolished release and still rate it negatively. Read below for the original review.\n=============================================================\nTL;DR: I am very disappointed with this version as Megaton Edition simply provided a better end-user experience.\nThe first thing that hit me was input lag on my mouse. I saw that the number of frames per second was equal to my monitor's refresh rate so I figured it has to be the fault of v-sync being on. The problem is - no such option is available in the options menu. I forced v-sync off in my video driver's settings and the input lag disappeared. However, my video card instantly became significantly louder as it started rendering the game in several hundred frames per second and again - there is no in-game option to limit the number of rendered frames. So what's so bad about it? Both options (v-sync and FPS limit) were available in the Megaton Edition...\nThe next thing I saw was a lack of texture filtering. This means we are bound to see the game pixelated, which looks out of place coupled with the enhanced lighting. And again - Megaton Edition had texture filtering options...\nAnother flaw is the unresponsiveness of the mouse wheel when bound to inventory cycling. Sometimes you have to scroll the wheel a few times just to cycle ONE item. It works a bit better with the v-sync turned on... but then I have the input lag back! And yup, you guessed it, in Megaton Edition it was working fine.\nAfter experiencing the above problems I ran the new episode, and I have to admit it is really good and enjoyable - it was made by experienced people and it clearly shows. It's just that the first impression was so bad I don't want to play it anymore.\nThe problem is - World Tour is the only officially available edition right now, which is still being sold. If you don't already have Duke Nukem 3D in your collection, then maybe it would be a good idea to buy it. Alternatively, you can look for a key for the Megaton Edition at 3rd party sites, as it is no longer officially available. The Megaton Edition does not contain the new episode (Alien World Order), but instead has three unofficial expansions (Life's a Beach, Duke it Out in D.C. and Nuclear Winter), which in turn are unavailable in World Tour (which is a puzzle to me). As for other, new features in this release - such as rewinding time after death, or developer commentary - I didn't really bother with them. The enhanced lighting is nice, but I saw it before in a fan source port EDuke32... which also has texture filtering (unlike World Tour). Proper 3D is also cool, but its lack never really bothered me in the first place as far as this game is concerned, so it's not a saving quality by any means.\nSo here is the thing: \"Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition\" was a much more polished product... offered for a twice lower price. If you decide to release Duke Nukem 3D again for a higher price than it used to be, you had better make sure this version is AT LEAST as polished as previous ones. Sadly, World Tour does not offer such quality.\nI'll stick to the Megaton Edition, which I was fortunate enough to buy while it was still available. Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour is going to be the second time ever for me when I refund a product on Steam.", "hours": 15.8, "username": "Patrol1985", "products": 239, "early_access": false},

Gearbox, after obtaining complete control of the Duke Nukem liscense, quickly whipped up this inferiour product for the anniversary of the game.\nIt's awful.\nThe engine itself has several bugs, not the least of which being it never seems to remember when it's supposed to be full screen. It always starts up windowed, even when full screen is chosen, forcing you to disable and renable it every time, and even then it's a crap shoot that it will actually work and go full screen.\nThe engine seems to run smoothly enough, which it should given that it's a twenty year old engine that's been very slightly modified. But the controls are a joke. No option to change the quick save/load (saving and loading has no confirmation, and you can't even make custom save names, just the default \"SLOT 1\", \"SLOT 2\" etc.) [Edit: One new engine feature, the ability to go back to any earlier point in your playthrough of the level before you died, does mitigate the need for the quicksave/load buttons, and is a nice feature to have], and I can't set anything to the side mouse buttons, 4 and 5. Which is where I prefer to have my Big Foot automatic kick melee attack.\nOn top of that, the Megaton Edition came with three of the DLC packs available for Duke Nukem 3D, of varying quality. None of those are available here. Instead, we get a brand new 5th chapter. And Steam Workshop support. The latter hosts several maps that are either ripped illegally from other packs, or converted from other games.\nDuke Nukem 3D was an amazing game when it came out. Megaton Edition was a fantastic, well modified engine that ran wonderfully on modern systems. This is a pathetic soulless cash grab. The only thing it has going for it is colored lighting, and even that could use some improvement.\nThat's enough about the engine.  So what about the GAME?  After all, to make up for the mission expansion packs, they added a whole new episode to the game.  Well, a smaller episode.  The theme is decent enough, and the first level shows some great tricks in it.  You're going from location to location across the globe.  The new enemy is somewhat frustrating, since it's pretty versatile, with several ways to hurt you and some ways to avoid damage.  The new weapon is quite fun, a modification of the freeze gun just as the microwave gun was a modification of the shrink ray.  The levels themselves overall aren't bad.  The music is awful though.  It just doesn't sound appropriate for Duke Nukem.  Nor for the levels you find yourself in.  More voice lines were added, and some older ones rerecorded.  I think I prefer the originals, but the new stuff is decent enough.\nIt's not worth the full price though.  It's barely worth the sale price.

This is amazing and video games of today could learn something from this as voice acting is a major feature video games overlook or don’t include for some reason, but the voice acting in Duke just makes the game 100% better)\n♦ FPS Elements on point (The first person shooter elements are on point, like if you overlook the bugs, annoyances, glitches etc and just purely look at the FPS elements, you can see they are pretty decent)\n♦ Boss variety and battles are bosstastic (The boss fights are some of the best I’ve encountered in games. Every boss is unique and challenging making them a great aspect of the game)\n♦ Duke Humour is bang on (Like the classic Duke games, the humour is still 100% bang on in this. If you like nothing else in the game, you can still appreciate the Duke Humour which makes Duke, Duke, in the classic Duke games)\n♦ Achievements are actually achievements (By this I mean that the achievements give you a sense of actually achieving something unlike some games where achievements are just handed to you as you play)\n♦ Nice weapon variety (There is enough different weapons to keep the game interesting)\n♦ Minigames inside of Duke are excellent (These are things like, air hockey, whack-a-mole, pinball, hoops, gym etc. These are all gems that just work amazingly, especially pinball which could have been a stand-alone game on it’s on)\n♦ Storyline is enjoyable (The storyline to this is enjoyable, nothing spectacular but nothing boring)\n♦ Multiplayer apartment customization based on Dukes multiplayer level is a nice concept (Nice concept, except for multiplayer being dead)\n♦ Graphics are good (They are not spectacular, but they are good. Could be better here and there but can’t complain)\n♦ Money’s worth (If you pick this up on sale you’ll definitely get your money’s worth in hours played. I played 15hours to beat the game which at full price is just over a dollar an hour)\nCons:\n♦ Doesn’t have Steam Trading Cards (This isn’t a major issue, just would have been a great addition to Steam to have some backgrounds, emotes, badges etc from one of the most loved video game series)\n♦ Slow and repetitive at times (Parts are very slow and repetitive due to walking to numerous places only having to walk back the way you came later on. Also, some ideas and concepts for levels are the same over and over. For example, when in the Monster Truck there are numerous levels where the main goal is to find gas and re-gas your truck, this happens more times than it needs to)\n♦ Walk here do this walk back (Annoying specially in the part where you are shrinked for the first time. It's so slow and annoying, really there isn't much fun content in this part)\n♦ Mini car buggy (Whilst shrinked at one stage you hop in a remote control car and if you didn't keep the car, you have to die to realize that you still needed it as you spawn in it upon revival. This makes the game annoying as the game doesn’t tell you that you needed to keep the car until you had no-where to go except dieing)\n♦Default keyboard controls are weird (This can be seen for example when four weapon mode is enabled. The keys are annoying as by default weapon selection of each weapon is bound to the number 1 key or mouse wheel. However, you can bind a key to each weapon in the control options. IMO, there should be a default setting that has all four weapons set to a key as having it set by default to one key makes it hard to quickly switch between all four weapons with the keyboard easily and quickly. Thus said, switching with mouse wheel works slightly quicker and easier, it's still not ideal. Hence you have to map the keys before you play with a keyboard which again, IMO, shouldn't have to be the case.)\n♦ Pipe Bomb auto throws (This concept is annoying as it makes it hard to use the pipe bomb as you can't select it and aim as, as soon as you hit the button it throws it)\n♦ If you die enough a part will seemingly become easier (This is annoying as it defeats the challenging aspect. I died like 3 times at one area and then some enemies seemingly didn't spawn... I was looking forward to beating that area...)\n♦ Hive Part 2 glitchy (I found this part really glitchy with some enemies not spawning, doors not opening when they should etc)\n♦ Can't skip some cutscenes (Annoying as we should have the option be able to skip them if we want)\n♦ Alt+Tab out and back into the game causes mad FPS drop (This is weird as sometimes when I alt+tabbed out of the game and back in my FPS would be really low. However, if I kept alt+tabbing in and out, eventually my FPS would rise again and go back to normal. Weird glitch that shouldn’t happen)\n♦ Dying at a checkpoint respawns all boxes and items (This makes the game way too easy, if you get a checkpoint and have no ammo you can die and everything will respawn including holo dukes etc, this makes the game way too easy at certain parts)\n♦ Game froze and crashed at one point (Refer to:\nFor a game that took 15 years to make, this is inexcusable)\n♦ Ending cinematic sucked (Worst in the whole game. For a game that took 15hours for me to finish playing only to end the way it did made me annoyed. I was expecting something bigger, more awesome and enjoyable to finish off the game. After 15 years in the making, I think they could have made a bigger, better finale for the game)\n♦ Multiplayer is dead (This is to be expected but multiplayer looked enjoyable until you realize there are only like 4 random people at most playing it)\n♦ DLC is expensive (I say this as one of the DLC’s is almost the same price as the original game and all it adds is Multiplayer content to a Multiplayer that is 99% dead… why pay $13 for a DLC for a dead Multiplayer?)\nOverall, I’d give this a 5/10. With that said, there are a lot of cons and slight glitches, bugs and annoyances that show the game is unpolished in areas that it shouldn’t be with a game that has taken 15 years to produce and make. Therefore, I feel if you put the cons aside and look at the pros, there are still decent FPS elements and the typical Duke humour still hits home to the classic Duke games. Thus, if you’re a long time Duke fan pick this up as you will get some enjoyment out of it. But if you’re new to the Duke series, I’d recommend skipping this and buying the other Duke games and then if you love them to check this out as Duke Nukem Forever isn’t a starting point to get into loving Duke. Also, I’d recommend waiting for it to be on sale for about $3-$5 and not paying full price for it.\nPS: If I could give this a neutral rating on Steam I would.", "hours": 15.9, "username": "KidwithSmurf", "products": 1302, "early_access": false},

Minor issues like being turned around whenever a quicksave happened or the single 'jump' grunt bugged me, but there were some big problems that are hard to overlook. Novelty stuff like the driving stages, the shrunk Duke sections, the barely there 'puzzles' slowed down the pace of the game incredibly and everything came to a screeching halt while the fun novelty is paraded out and you're told how great the game is.

When it dropped the novelty stuff and focused on being a shooter, it worked well.

Almost every gamer has heard about this game and it's seen by many as one of the best first person games from the 90's. This is the first time I have actually played the game (I tried the megaton edition but the controls were off, can't explain what it was. It was unbearable for me.) It stands the test of time really well (unless you're a social justice warrior). The levels are well designed and reward exploration by having a lot of secrets.\nThe game has a true 3D mode. This renders the game in real 3D (intesd of the original 2.5D engine). This improves the graphics, adds better lighting and removes the distorion of the original when looking up and down. A nice touch is that you can siwtch between the rendering modes by pressing a button. This allows you to see the improvements in the grapics at any time.\nThe Build endinge is used to great effect here. There are working pool tables, light switches can be toggled, movie projecters can be switched on and off and Duke can even take a look at the security systems. This version of the game contains 5 episodes. Episode 1-3 is great, although episode 2 has too many of the exploding dones. Episode 4 is tough but still great. Episode 5 was made for this version of the game by the guys who made the original episodes. And it is reaaly good. My biggest complaints about episode 5 is the difficulty and the boss fight. The episode is really hard. I spent most of my time with a health bar that was below 45. The last boss is also a big dissapointment.\nThere was also a few bugs. The game crashed once during my time with it. There is a wierd bug with the weapons selection. I switched to a new weapons and after firing one shot the game equiped the previous weapon. This happend a lot ( about once or twice per level) and evel ended up in me being killed. Speaking of dying, the game used a rewind system when you die. This is something I like, mostly because I am not used to quick saving (even in games like quake, I save manually) and would have lost a lot of progress if I couldn't rewind. It also allows you to get better times in levels. If I got stuck and took a while to find ou where to go next, I would kill myself and rewind to the point I began searching for the way forward. That way I didn't use a guide, didn't have to reapeat a level and still got a good time.\nOne thing that does hurt this game is that the expansions included in the Megaton edition isn't here. I hope that this will be added as DLC later. The game is great value for money and really fun. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes 90's FPS games (Although they probably have it), who want to check out one of the best 90's FPS games and anyone who like Duke Nukem Forever.", "hours": 16.2, "user_id": "76561198072680595", "username": "76561198072680595", "products": 762, "early_access": false},

The level design is great, it really feels like something from the old times, in a good way, and there's some creativity and new ideas that put them on par with the original levels, the music is nice, the new \"quicksave/quickload\" option is good, but everything else is mediocre. I expected way more from a freaking 20th Anniversary version, after so many years since the fourth episode, the fifth one only shows one new enemy (with recycled sounds from another enemy) and one new weapon, all with almost the exact gameplay. The final boss is a joke, no challenge at all and it's just a red cycloid emperor with a flamethrower. It's so bad, that I had already read it was just a reskin and nothing original and even with these low expectations I was still disappointed. Good level design alone isn't enough to pay full price for this edition. If you have Megaton Edition, don't get this, it's not worth it. If you want multiplayer or don't have any other version of Duke Nukem 3D, wait for a very big discount. It's embarrassing what comes from the official sources when you see the marvels the fans have made with mods like HRP or Duke Plus.

{"product_id": "57900", "page": 30, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-03-11", "text": "Have you ever seen the Mona Lisa? The Creation of Adam? The Statue of David? These are all considered to be timeless works of art, are they not? Perhaps you would think so, were you some sort of uneducated, classless troglodyte. Every single one of these said \"Works of art\" are a complete waste of time, resources and \"artistic talent\" when compared to the masterpiece that is Duke Nukem Forever.\nDuke Nukem is the human form: perfected. His body is better than that of any Greek \"God,\" his fashion sense is striking and simplistic. His outfit consists of a pair of timeless blue jeans, black boots, black shades and a striking bright red tank top. The red colouring on his top created as a representation of the fire Prometheus stole from the \"Gods\" of Olympus. Duke Nukem is the light, the energy and the life the fire brought to humanity given form in the shape of a glorious, butt kicking, one liner spewing millionaire hero.\nDuke wears a pair of fingerless black leather gloves that bear the trefoil symbol. This logo is used to warn people of radiation. The symbol is placed there as a representation of the awesome, unstoppable power that his fists present, warning anyone close by that they can and will be utterly annihilated should they dare stand before him. His character design is no doubt thoughtful. I may even go as far as saying it is a work of absolute genius.\nUpon the top of Dukes mighty head, his hair proudly stands. His golden flat top points upwards, thrust towards the heavens as a direct challenge to God. It at once questions the might of our so called lord through its defiance of his \"laws\" of gravity and acts as a reminder to anyone fortunate enough to bear witness to Duke that he is unquestionably powerful and unnaturally beautiful.\nDuke has a flawless personality. He is charming, kind, funny and reliable. He roams throughout the world protecting the weak and vulnerable, signing autographs for children, complimenting women and dedicating his life to saving the planet from alien invasion. He is a hero in every sense of the word. And my God does he manage to entertain us with his heroics. I'm unsure as to how many times I've heard him reference \"Porkchop sandwiches\" in some way, but I guarantee I'll never get tired of it. His voice is like sweet nectar, flowing smoothly into my ears like warm honey into a hot drink. It sends shivers down my spine, I adore it. As does every single woman in the world, apparently. Duke is so beautiful that every human with ovaries lusts over him constantly. I can almost see Zeus now, looking down from Mt. Olympus, green with envy.\nSo, now that you know how amazing Duke is, how does the game stand up?\nThe game is flawless. It is amazing. I loved every single second of it and I promise that I will continue to love it for many years to come. The game has a unique system of health management. You see, Duke Nukem has such a deservedly large ego that it is actually strong enough to deflect incoming attacks. His ego can be increased through completing various tasks or minigames. The most notable of which is grabbing a turd from a toilet with your bare hands. This is satire at its most high brow. I wouldn't expect an individual of lower intelligence to fully grasp the concept of handling feces and the wider implications of such an action upon the world. Truly unbelievable.\nThe enemies of this game are an alien race made up of pig like creatures. This is smart, as it directly ties back to the numerous references Duke makes to various porkchop related foodstuffs. Genius wordplay, absolutely brilliant. Shakespeare would be quaking in his pathetic little boots were he not rotting in the ground like the miserable excuse for a playwright he is. Duke is the future, and moronic individuals like Shakespeare have rightfully been consigned to history, for they have no right to exist at the same time as Duke Nukem.\nThe gunplay is absolutely phenomenal. There are a wide variety of weapons Duke can make use of, all of which are masterfully designed, powerful and satisfying. My favourite weapon has to be the classic golden m1911. This weapon is a staple of Duke Nukem’s design. It’s golden colour a representation of opulence and beauty. The trefoil on the handle a symbol of power. Were Duke Nukem a gun, he would be this weapon.\nThe level design of this game is absolutely phenomenal. I admire how the developers made the levels as complicated as possible and gave absolutely no pointers to the player as to how to reach their end. In my opinion, this is a fantastic feature, as it means that all the low IQ imbeciles that would otherwise play this game are deterred to make way for the intelligent individuals to truly appreciate this wonderful game. The puzzles are well thought out and not at all overdone. The shrinking mechanic is used repeatedly in the game throughout multiple levels. I’m glad the developers repeated this mechanic so much as it is incredibly entertaining, and properly shows off the ability of the developers to think on different scales to give the player a varied, exciting experience that won’t soon be forgotten. The valve puzzles would be good, but Duke says he doesn’t like them so I don’t either.\nThe driving sections are simply brilliant. I’ve played my fair share of driving games. Burnout? Dreadful. Forza? What a joke. DiRT? Awful. Assetto Corsa? Pathetic. Test Drive Unlimited? Are you serious? None of these “games” even come close to capturing the thrill of high speed driving. The monster truck in Duke Nukem Forever handles like a dream. And indeed you may feel as though you are dreaming the greatest dream of your life as you race through the desert. Speeding over the sand in your monster truck while flattening all manner of aliens and performing the same jump over and over. It absolutely does not overstay its welcome and is not at all repetitive or overdone. I’d play an entire game dedicated to the driving sections in Duke Nukem Forever. I live for them, I breathe for them. I’d marry that damned monster truck.\nThe boss fights are absolutely fantastic. These alien creatures of epic proportions stand before Duke like dominos before a raging tornado. They are big, they are ugly, and I guarantee Duke will mention this. You fight them using the explosive weapons in your arsenal. These weapons are powerful and exceedingly entertaining to use. They definitely do not have too low an ammo supply. Even if they did, there’s always an ammo box sitting nearby for you to use if you’re a moron who has absolutely no skill or tactical thought process. I suppose we’re not all perfect, are we? You finish off the bosses with a humiliation move. I’m fairly certain all of these moves involve genitalia in some way. How could they not? These finishing moves are the epitome of adult comedy and only serve to cement the intelligence level of the game and its writing. The finishing moves are always followed by some sort of one liner. However, they’re all so funny that I’ve forgotten them.\nOverall, I believe this game may perhaps be the greatest one ever made. It’s far better than any of those other games people love. If you think that any game is better than this one, well… I’m sure your parents are really happy living a life pretending not to be disappointed in you. I’d give this game a numerical rating, but I believe it surpasses such simplicity. Such an elegant masterpiece cannot be rated, it can only be experienced and loved.\n2/5", "hours": 25.3, "username": "Noginfoggle", "products": 255, "found_funny": 6, "early_access": false},

However, not all is as great as it would suit Duke - the cardinal sin of the game is that it feels somewhat console-oriented - low FOV, bad mouse sensitivity, weapon limits, health regen, lots of QTEs, etc. This sort of design makes it a bit hard to take it as a proper \"old-school\" shooter that harkens back to the old times, when action heroes could hold a truck load of weaponry while sprinting without getting out of breath and used med packs to heal themselves rather than waiting in a corner to auto heal. But, if you don't mind this too much, you will find a solid and fun game here that doesn't take itself dead serious and is rather a parody of the FPS genre and what it (used to) stood for.", "hours": 3.0, "user_id": "76561198136975055", "username": "noobean", "products": 180, "early_access": false},

However, while the port is intesting, it's no match to the defunct Megaton Edition, which was wayyyyyy more.... eeer.... complete in terms of adventures you can play.\nDuke Nukem 3D was released 20 years ago and was in the pure line of FPS back then. Duke Nukem was also a colorful character, interested in booze and babes, if you allow me to use the term often used in the game. Well, let's just say that some alien civilisation is invading Earth and kidnapping women to use them for breeding. Yeah, just that.\nDuke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour has the four original episodes (L.A. Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse, Shrapnel City and The Birth) and includes a new one: Alien World Order. And this is where the disappointment begins, because the Megaton Edition included other campaigns: one in a tropical paradise island that I really loved and another one in Washington DC, with many known landmarks. Unless the future of the game includes these episodes, I would say that the 20th Anniversary World Tour is already inferior to the Megaton Edition in terms of content.\nYou're going to say that a new weapon has been included in the last episode and I will counter back to you that while a flamethrower is nice, I didn't expect to have a new enemy that can do the same for you and that I never expected to have a sort of lava when missing my target and hurting because I've stepped in it.\nAs for the rest, it's still nice to have a mighty foot, to use a simple pistol, a shotgun, a minigun, a rocket launcher, pipebombs, a minimizer/maximizer, a ice gun (which can hurt you too), mine lasers (that I don't use at all), the Devastator. They can be used underwater, which is nice.\nAnd apart the traditional armor, you can also count on\nEnemies are still the same: you still have simple troopers, the pig cops, the minigun lizard that is quick to die with shotgun but not with the minigun, the octobrain, sharks (yeah, simple sharks), turrets and many others. The bosses are still hard to defeat (and guess what, the new one is using fire - new weapon, new enemies, everything has to do with fire).\nBut you know what's caught me a few times? The way to change my weapons. I don't know why it was so hard to do it but I ended up with the wrong one (or I can't press the right button or it's just that the little inventory with them felt slow to jump from a weapon to another).\nI didn't really pay to the graphics: for me, they're the same. They didn't really change a bit from Megaton Edition. But well, I'm still in awe in front of the levels: the death row, the space station, the city and with the new episode, I really liked the fact that we were visiting some cities, like London, Paris and Moscow. And it's still a pleasure to discover restaurants, Duke Burgers or even a supermarket. Oh wait, there is also a kind of weird level where the hookah made you really high on drugs (or not). Really, it's still a pleasure to play these levels.\nThe soundtrack is nice but.... why put the default sound volumn so low that we can't really enjoy it? Is this for Duke to say his famous lines to which I didn't pay attention?\nAnother thing is the achievement. They're classic but I wish some of them were included. We have easter eggs about Luke Skywalker, Serious Sam (new episode) and the DoomGuy that are worthy of an achievement but Indiana Jones or even the Star Trek bridge aren't? And what about the Kurt Russell one? And why not to have an achievement about finishing some levels with all secrets discovered? And while it's nice to see an achievement about enemies being scrunched or incinerated, why not one about being iced and destroyed by the mighty foot? Or being blown up because of the maximizer? It would have been great to have more achievements.\nI didn't try the multiplayer and I don't intend to do so.\nIf I have to resume my experience with Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversay World Tour? I prefer Megaton Edition. More content. For those who own it, the 20th Anniversary World Tour is only worthy of being in your library for the new episode, only when you have a discount. At 20 bucks, i don't feel like enough has been done - putting developers commentaries, a new episode, a new enemy, a new boss and a new weapon isn't really enough as I didn't see a difference in graphics or in soundtrack. I've still enjoyed the game, though I must say that my first experience with Duke was with Megaton Edition, so, there is no nostalgia trip for me.", "hours": 16.6, "username": "Vic=HKC=", "products": 2392, "early_access": false},

Using the mouse-wheel to scroll through weapons painfully slows down gun swapping because of the new mini-hud. These two effects combined makes in-game reaction time feel slow.\nThe original DOS game had no option to switch between auto-aim on or off. It was always 'on'. I recommend you leave it that way for this port or several weapons, particularly the pistol,  end up being frustratingly useless.\nThe Alien World Order episode is enjoyable for the most part. The maps are well designed, detailed, and constructed; with the exception of the final map, Hollywood Inferno. A few maps have odd enemy placement, as well as poor distrubution and location of weapons and healing supplies, with Hollywood Inferno being the worse offender of the lot. The incredibly easy final boss fight didn't help improve the perception any.\nThe anti-climatic final showdown, and only getting 8 maps instead of the traditional 11 that are in the original episodes, makes the overall experience merely good instead of great.\nI'd recommend purchasing this, but only when it's on sale.

That would be amazing!\nThe original sounds are also worse than the previous editions and the sounds are all muffled up; as if your speaker were covered with a pillow (Edit: there is a patch that fixes the sound issues).\nThe game is good but it doesn't really deserve a $21.99 price tag.

I don't think I need to say much more than that.\nNow, before you all say \"What does that mean,\" of which I will tell you, know that this following review is from a lifelong fan of the Duke games. That does in fact include DNF.\nMost people I know have probably watched or played Duke 3D, and those that haven't sure has hell know about it and how iconic it is. Thus, I won't go into the gameplay details-know that this is a classic, right up there with Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM from the 90s. This is one of those first person shooters that is just iconic, and not for the graphics it has, though good for the era it came out 21 years ago, was hardly top of the line back even then. No, why this game is so lauded and praised is for the gameplay, and the MIDI music has become legendary and sononomous with gaming. I've not seen a single gamer that doesn't have an appreciation for Grabbag.\nThis, by the way, is the Megaton Edition re-released as a digital version with a few additional things. You've got developer tidbits from the original gang from 3D Realms, accounting the journey that brought us this classic. John St. John lent his voice for this one again, so if you're not like me and don't appreciate the DOS-era quality of his voice, you can flip off the Legacy Duke voice and hear him sans Duke Forever style. Other than that, the game IS the full game circa Megaton Edition, and has made modding that much simpler by allowing Steam Workshop. And unlike other remakes of older DOS classics on Steam today, like Day of the Tentacle, this is just a re-release with extra polish and a different way to hear Duke. This isn't a remake-this is a re-release of the game that made Duke \"The Duke.\"\nHowever, as a fan of the series, that ALSO means I'm somewhat critical of things that are glaringly off. This game doesn't run in DOSBox-and that may seem like a minor issue to some, but this game 21 years ago was a DOS game. It ran beautifully, so I would have loved Gearbox if to honor that legacy that released by 3D Realms 21 years ago if they also made this a DOS game and added onto the original DOS game and its expansion packs. Instead they opted to release the game as a Windows port of that and add on the rest of what they did, creating along the way some bugs that prevent you from using a keycard at times. Relaunching fixes this, but still, it's kind of annoying. I'm also not a fan of how this game doesn't take advantage of modern-day saving techniques with the OPTION of cloud saves. If I do end up getting a new PC 3 or 4 years down the road or have to replace my hard drive in this one, that means that I lose all my save data. I'm not complaining really about this, it's just a minor annoyance to me-I'm actually also happy they opted not to as Duke 3D didn't allow cloud saving as the cloud didn't EXIST then. What I AM annoyed about and complaining is the lack of ability to NAME my save. I'm forced to save it as Save 1 or Save 2, not able to name the save with the level that I'm on, like Dukeburger or Death Row, like you could in the original release. I'm also annoyed by the fact this game supports controllers like the XBOX One controller. Yeah, I, the guy who has that exact controller sitting right next to my laptop and loves games like Saints Row and Fallout and can't inagine using anything but a controller for modernday first person shooters, said it, but there's a reason for that. Duke 3D never allowed controller support save a joystick, so considering this is a re-release, adding modernday controller support makes sense as the idea of the joystick did evolve to that, but Duke 3D was released originally in an era where playing a video game 9 times out of 10 meant you used a keyboard and (if you had one) a mouse as they were known for being complex as far as controls went. Sure you had some games that were playable and even some that were designed in a way that made them preferable to play on a gamepad, like the Jazz Jackrabbit and original Tomb Raider games (being designed with the PSX in mind, if I recall), but with Duke 3D, using one for me makes the game controls feel rather clunky and I ended up opting to the keyboard and mouse, which is what I'm used to anyways and was what the game was designed to work with natively. I also am not a fan of how Legacy Duke Voice is off by default in a game that is designed to honor a legend that launched 21 years ago now.\nOverall, though, this game is a classic. As I said before, it's Duke Nukem 3D. This is a game that was great back then, and 20 years later, is even greater. It's one that I would very highly encourage you snag up, as a fan of Duke or not, from that era or not, whether you grew up with it or not, whether you appreciate this game for its gameplay or just its historical value, of which I'll get into in a moment. In short, GET THIS ONE. Seriously. Fan or not, I have to give this one a rating of a solid 1,000,000/10 here. You can't do wrong with The Duke.\nNow, for history class. This game didn't exactly have the best graphics, even of its day 21 years ago, but what this game did right and what spurred the dedication of fans globally and resulted in the game where 3D Realms took off and became a big name in gaming in the 90s was how it played. The story that it told may have been simplisitic, but it pulled cues from Hollywood, mocking it to some and paying a goofy homage to it to others, but however you look at it, those cues really polarized this game to many at the time as this was the era where we had movies like Jurassic Park, Titanic, Independence Day, and Men in Black 1. The fact that this rode off the wave that Hollywood was riding that decade in its story (aliens invade, so one badass dude goes in and kicks ailen butt) was how this game polarized itself in an era where you had it going against games like Half-Life, Doom, and Wolfenstein 3D on PC and even console games like FF7, Super Mario 64, and Pokemon, all in an era where PC gaming was starting to slide into what was thought as oblivion with 3Dfx starting to fade, resulting in their eventual buyout by nVIDIA, which is why I think NVIDIA is the powerhouse they are today, riding off the Voodoo basis they got with 3Dfx. It was the games from that era, of which Duke 3D played an integral part, that really helped shape the FPS genre into what it's become today. Without this game, like its humor or not, we probably wouldn't have games like Call of Duty or Battlefield today.

Of course you probably didn't know Duke 3D Atomic edition was already available on Steam at one point, right? Well suddenly, the game disappeared off the Steam store, and now we replace it with this overall mediocre version of Duke Nukem 3D.\nIt pales in comparison to Atomic Edition for a lot of reasons. A lack of DLC expansion episodes that came with the previous version. Duke it out in DC, Nuclear Winter and Life's a Beach are all suspiciously missing. The level editor has now been streamlined for Steam workshop, which of course is a positive, however I cannot forgive the lack of the expansions. A new episode was added, \"officially\" made by Gearbox, however it really lacked something about it overall. Yeah, there's Serious Sam jokes hammed in, and it has a \"Around the World in 80 days\" kinda atmosphere going on, but I just cannot forgive some of the clearly lazy efforts given by Gearbox in trying to replace Atomic Edition.\nOverall, I can only recommend this to either hardcore fans or people who have never played Duke Nukem before, but if you ask me, this felt like some kind of desperate attempt to cash grab with a \"NEW AND FRESH\" version of Duke without filling out the true quality of the Atomic Edition, while asking for a hefty price tag.\n(P.S.

They didn't include any of the previous expansions, so you're just left with a \"Brand New Fifth Episode\" with a pretty anti-climactic ending and a horrible new weapon.\nHere are the tips for you \"GearF**ks\" on how to make this the best \"Duke Nukem 3D\" remaster there is:\n- Add all of the expansions from \"Megaton Edition\". (\"Caribbean: Life's a Beach\", \"Nuclear Winter\" and ''Duke it out in D.C.). You can also include the episode \"Plug and Pray\" from DK 3D on PS1 but remade and maybe even add \"Lame Duke\" if you'll complete the original 4 episodes on \"Come get some\" difficulty (Of course all of these expansions should have an option of \"True 3D\"). And most importantly, all of these expansions should be \"FREE DLC\" not \"PAID DLC\", or they could just be updates.\n-  Add a \"Gallery\" to the main menu so every time you complete 1 or sometimes 2 levels, a new artwork will be unlocked. There could be a total of 20-25 artworks.\n- Where the actual ♥♥♥♥ is the story?! Make it like in Serious Sam: TFE where you begin a game and a text scrolls down showing the new players what happened in DK 1 and DK 2, so that the new Duke fans would know the plot. (I know no one cares about the plot of DN3D but whatever)\nPro's:\n- The ''True 3D\" is pretty dope.\n- The \"Fifth Episode\" is enjoyable for the most part, but the new weapon is just horrible.\n- Mods support!! (JK, it was in \"Megaton Edition\" too, but it was removed recently).\nCon's:\n- No expansions, really?!!

If you have ever had the pleasure of rampaging through the original game, then you may be interested in revisiting those days with the 20th Anniversary World Tour.\nKeep in mind that a remastered edition, or an anniversary commemoration, is not a reimagining of the game, but is the original game including some changes, many of which are subtle. The episodes include: “L.A. Meltdown,” “Lunar Apocalypse,” “Shrapnel City,” “The Birth,” and “Alien World Order.” There are a lot of areas that you can tackle the alien hordes with either your friends at your side, or with your own Rambo impulses.\nFor the full review, go here -", "hours": 1.0, "username": "GamingCypher", "products": 356, "early_access": false},

It's less like him whispering to himself and more like him commentating on the situation. I'm sure it makes more sense for him to whisper to himself rather than commentating, as there is no one (except the players) that can hear him. The quality is similar to the Forever voices, so if you don't enjoy it, you could select the old voices in the options menu. You cannot use the old voices in the new episodes though.\nThe enviromental enhancements include some cool lighting effects and 3D rendered graphics instead of the 2D looking sprites in the original. It brings out the glow in neon lighting, the flash when you shoot your gun, even the movie posters are lit. It provides some life into the game. The 3D graphics is pretty cool. In the original when you look at the tall building above you, the building looks like it's leaning over your head, because you're looking at the 2D sprite. The 3D graphics actually makes it look more like a 3D building. Not sure how to explain it, as I'm not too technical about this. The 2D sprites from character models are still there however. These enviromental enhancements will cause some framerate drops for low end machines, but can be turned off to the original graphics if you wish.\nThe new episode features Duke travelling the world to kick alien♥♥♥♥♥ What's funny about this is that he already travelled around the world in the NDS title \"Duke Nukem: Critical Mass,\" which is a washed-down version of the \"Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project.\" These new levels are designed by two level designers from the original game, and the music from the original composer. Thus, original DN3D will find something they love (hopefully). The new episode also contain a new enemy type named the Firefly. These guys are unique when you first encounter them, as they strink in size to avoid your bullets, but once you find an explosive weapon, they're easy to kill. The Firefly uses the flamethrower weapon which does some damage in contact plus damage over time due to the burning effects. This flamethrower weapon can be used by Duke, and it's pretty overpowered. This version does not include the expansion packs like in Megaton edition, namely, Duke it out DC, Carribean, etc, but I think Gearbox might have a plan for them later in the future (during their 20th anniversary perhaps?).\nThe multiplayer is\nsimilar to the Megaton edition. Like the Megaton edition, multiplayer has a lobby system where everyone joins in the beginning of the match. No one is allowed to join during the game. There's no chat box in lobbies and disconnection is real. This is probably why no one is playing it. You can play with bots in DM, but they're only there for single player purposes, i.e. you cannot play with people and bots at the same time. There's also a bug that prevents you from playing workshop maps with bots, which is a shame. The bots are dumb too, so there isn't much satisfaction in mowing them down with a chaingun, or even a pistol.\nWorkshop is back and people can create their own maps using a free software Mapster32. The sky texture for some of the maps have the pink textures which means missing texture (?). Some workshop maps don't work in the original enviroment settings, and will crash the game. You can also play maps that are outside of steam. (1) Download a map from the\narchives,\nsite, or even in the Megaton workshop, (2) put them in the main folder of the 20th anniversary folder (3) Launch game (4) bring out console and type \"map <map name>.\" For example, if I wanted to play the church.map, I would type \"map church\" in console and it'll load up the map. I played the Roch series like this, heh heh. The one thing you can't do is put in the custom voices and music like you can with Megaton.\nThe inital release of this game had muffled voices and weapon sounds. This has been fixed. The mouse acceleration is enabled at all times, and it's a bit annoying.\n\"Blow it out your♥♥♥♥♥quot;\n\"Eat♥♥♥♥♥♥and die\"\nUpdate: Upon testing the multiplayer with my friend with both Megaton and 20th Anniversary, we find that the latter has more stable connection. In Megaton, there is always a second delay from pressing a button and the game's response. Yet, 20th Anniversary is a lot more responsive.", "hours": 212.6, "username": "Redxplatinum", "products": 399, "early_access": false},

This edition of the game includes the original three episodes of Duke 3D, The Birth from the Atomic Edition, as well as an all new fifth episode made by developers of the original game. The new levels are great fun to play, adding a new weapon and some new enemies as you progress through them. The new levels also seamlessly fit in with the rest of the game design wise, which is nice to see.\nThere is one glaring issue I have with this version of the game however, and that is the exclusion of the expansions found in the Megaton Edition previously sold on Steam (Duke it out in D.C., Nuclear Winter, and Caribbean - Life's a Beach). I'm sure there was a good reason to not include them in this version, but it is definitely a noticeable hit to the overall content of the package. Hopefully they can be added later to the game somehow.\nWith that said, the content that’s there is good and definitely worth looking into, especially if you've never played Duke Nukem before and are interested.

Like it had the original devs yeah but the Commentary was overhyped cause it literately sounded like a Let's play; I mean I even heard the controller clacking and clicking in the dev's hand as they talked.\nNot only that, the new levels lacked... Colors and vibrant environments,  Amsterdam was a good start then, dark and grungy russian streets. Then to a dark and grungy looking  streets in Britian. The only enjoyable levels were the ones Allan Blum the Third made...The pyramid was awesome with a nice Fifth Element reference theme, The Golden Bridge was alright but it was WAY Too dark. Like YEAH it's made by the original devs which is owned by a generic shooter factory that took these levels and took a nice squirty dump of craptastic cliches of modern Shooters and the boss? Goddamn dude, How could Allan Blum The Third allow that? In the Commentary, Blum said \"You know back in the original, you went up an elevator and BAM there was a boss, I wanted to do something different and cause tension by adding in this build up.\" Not word for word but The only reason he did that is cause the mini boss before the actual boss which is the Cycloid Emperor was harder, meaning they know the cycloid Incinerator sucked!\nTo make matters worse, to show how the dev team behind it were so freaking incompetent, The secret level \"Prima Arena\" They tried to make the level less confusing by cutting sectors out, Which is blocking the area's off but NOT REMOVING THE ENEMIES IN THE BLOCKED OFF SECTORS! Thus making it impossible to 100% the level without cheating and no clipping! Gearbox knew this game was gonna flop from the lack luster final boss and cookie cutter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t level design, which is why they removed the Megaton Edition.

Bethesda? You know the company who made DOOM 2016 like a champ and not failed like Duke Nukem Forever?

I remember playing the original and honestly, that felt a whole lot better than this. However, this is not even remotely the same game with a better look. This game is filled with design choices from the voice acting, the animations, the models, the awful textures, the ridiculously undetailed look of some areas even in the very beginning, and just an all-around bad pacing. It makes no sense. One moment, you're drawing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on a white board (you know that's why they put it there) and the next you're navigating a dozen random corridors leading to things that have nothing to do with the worldbuilding, story, action, or comedy. You're just forced to walk around like you don't have anything better to do. Any semblance of actual action is constantly broken by minigames that are more of a pain to do than actually fun. The aliens look and feel terrible, killing them gives you no satisfaction whatsoever. The script is just bad. One could argue the game has always been this cynical take on the state of America, capitalism and sexuality, but at least it used to be funny. Now, you are forced to go around fixing your secret base overrun with aliens, having to enter \"duke-vision\" which produces the type of high-pitched sound that you will want to shoot whoever chose this design in the first place after the first few minutes, tapping space over and over and fixing things by having to navigate said random corridors, do minigames that feel extremely out of place, and sure, kill a few things along the way because they're just in the way, all to have the horrendously badly-scripted A.I. to say \"you really know how to turn a girl on\" in the most unfunny way humanly possible. Was I suppsoed to laugh when the entire intro sequence turned out to be a videogame, only to be followed by half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥twin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ references, what the hell?

There are hidden doors everywhere so you keep clicking the action button on everything, but also certain secret passages can only be accessed if you blow something up or solve a button puzzle. Something new and interesting happens every now and then.\n\nThe problem is that this crazyness lacks context. Like, there is some vague implication of an alien invasion, but that is all you get. So yes, you go though the level and it is fun, but what the hell am I doing? I guess a lot of games were like that back then. There is also not a whole lot of flow or rhythm to the game, as again was the case with many games back then.

There is something about that type of graphics (like Doom and Road Rash) that does not age and always looks nice. It is only when something blows up that things look rather...edgy and fake. There is no natural transition between the thing being there and the thing getting blown up.\nThe game is ok, and in many ways holds up after all these years, but there sure are better shooters to play nowadays.

Having tried this with co-op, I can ABSOLUTELY say do not buy this for co-op unless you can find a work around for it. No matter who hosted the server, we kept on crashing like crazy, so do not bother, multiplayer is dead anyways and with a good reason. Also switching weapons with the scroll wheel is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly slow and STILL hasn't been fixed among other things making World Tour definitely feel like a cashgrab instead of a celebration of one of the best shooters of all time on PC. If theres a positive to this re-release its that it exposes you to the Duke/Build engine community which is incredibly friendly, but that cant be attributed to WT and more for the Duke/Build shooter fanbase itself. Editing this review to fit this new experience.\nDuke Nukem 3D is a great game, and this re-release holds up...mostly well. With dev commentary, a slightly updated version of the engine with less motion sick inducing 3D as well as the ability to swap between visuals on the fly by pressing C, great level designs in both the new and old levels, and the good old crass humor of old shooters, there's a lot to love, but I can't personally recommend this version of the game, unless you've never played Duke 3D.\nThe main issue comes with the price tag, $20. This game is an updated version of the Atomic Edition, which contained the first four episodes and was sold on GoG originally for $6 (For reference it ran on DoSbox unless you got the Eduke32 sourceport for better resolution and graphical options). It was re-released as the Megaton Edition with support for modern OS'/resolutions and came bundled with official expansion packs that are rare and expensive to find along, and then both versions were taken off shelves due to legal issues. Though this re-release adds a bit, the dev commentary only appears in a few select levels, and the new episode though great is incredibly short. Duke Nukem's original voice actor also returns which is a positive but some lines sound off and it just doesnt mesh well compared to the rest of the old sound effects. The biggest crime this re-release does is that there isn't enough new content leaving you want more and right now there's 0 news on new patches or support further down the line compared to what Battleborn or Borderlands got, leaving a release meant to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the game feel like a cashgrab with new content being held hostage by Gearbox if you owned any number of prior versions.\nIf this game does gets a $5 pricetag later down the line or appears in a Humble Bundle then by all means grab it and ignore the negative review, but for now skip it. And if you do own any number of versions you wont miss this at all considering fans are making fixes to get the 20th anniversary content running in EDuke32, along with the fact that its still Duke Nukem 3D but there's barely any new content in it to justify the higher price tag.", "hours": 12.0, "username": "Haloman", "products": 337, "early_access": false},

There is even a hotkey to swap between new and updated graphics just to let you see the huge improvement. The real benefit is the lighting. The lighting gives the game a whole new depth really bringing out its classic detail.\nThe new episode 5 is also a blast, the new enemies really being a pain when they need to be (especially the first level of all things). Sadly I found the new weapon to be a bit lacking, Its a really strong and fun weapon however it just doesn't feel right, from the ammo you shoot to the sound effect it gives its just a tad dull. Though saying that having new levels from the original designers as well as all new DukeTalk from Jon himself really hits you with a wave a nostalgia not to mention they actually updated all his old lines too.\nThere is also developer commentary throughout the game which is a joy to listen to as it ranges from them simply making fun of each other to them talking about the mindset of making certain stages which is great. The only downside to this is that I almost feel there isn't enough of it. They don't have it in every level and in some levels where they do they only have a couple of things to say.\nHowever that being said, this game, unless you don't have the Megaton edition isn't worth the price. If your a hardcore Duke 3D fan like myself that is. The Megaton edition comes with all the levels (except the new episode 5) as well as the 3 expansions the game got, which for some odd reason World Tour doesn't come with. For me personally I don't regret it for a moment as the updated engine and new episode as well as the dev commentary really shows how much heart and soul they put into this. For some I'd say pass until its cheaper however if you really are a big fan then don't hesitate.\nI also heard in one of the commentary moments them saying they would love to make the game again in completely next gen graphics/engine if the fans wanted it, so if you really do enjoy duke make sure to voice it!", "hours": 12.2, "username": "Luminous", "products": 957, "early_access": false},
{"product_id": "434050", "page": 38, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-01-06", "text": "I can see why Duke Nukem 3D was such a sensation upon release. It had gore! And one-liners! And pop-culture references! And quasi-realism! And sleaze! And macho-ness! And \"attitude!\" And possibly unintentional irony! And scantily-clad women just scattered around for no reason! It was EDGY! And it was the 90s! And it was an FPS, just to top it off!\nAside from that, it had a lot of cutting-edge technical features. It was the first game to have vertical-enabled mouselook, swimming, and (limited) reloading, for a start. (Unless you count Marathon, but Marathon existed in its own weird little Mac bubble apart from the rest of PC gaming.) Also, it had an inventory, a feature that had been present in previous games (Heretic and HeXen), but its items were a bit more grounded in plausibility than HeXen's, and they were actually useful as well. Finally, they copied Dark Forces's technique for creating multi-layer levels by just putting teleports all over the place. In 1996, Duke Nukem 3D was every PC gamer and teenage boy's dream.\nOn its own merits, however, Duke Nukem's just fine. It's a competently made shooter, with few distinguishing features. The weapon loadout's nice and varied, although the Shrink Ray and Devastator are stupidly overpowered. You take damage surprisingly quickly; this is no DOOM or Half-Life, where you can take a rocket to the face and basically be alright. If you take a rocket to the face in Duke Nukem 3D, you're either dead or dragging yourself across the ground by the skin of your broken teeth (I guess that's what Duke gets for wearing a tank top instead of power armor). The pixel art's pretty good overall, and the sound is primitive but definitely intelligible. The level design evokes realistic environments without being in any way realistic; it's also about as unintuitive and mazey as FPS levels get at times. Some parts of some levels seem to require the use of expendable items, which is a bit of a poor design choice, but it's not a major issue. The game overall is actually fairly short, requiring only about 5 hours to finish the first three episodes. It's occasionally frustrating, but overall pretty smooth to get through. As I said before, it's fine.\nThis Steam port is also basically functional. There's a weird glitch where occasionally the game decides that the player has died for no reason, but quicksaves minimize the issue, and other than that I experienced no problems. It's always nice to be able to toggle older and newer graphics and sound.\nOverall, I can recommend this game. It's a big piece of gaming history, and it's not unenjoyable to get through.

It doesn't even include the third-party additions, which, to be honest, were not that great.\nIf you're new to this whole Duke Nukem universe, I'd say get this version on sale. $20 is not worth the asking price of what you're getting here, but this is definitely not a bad way of playing the original game. It has the original four episodes, which will keep you occupied for hours, and you won't be gimped on the core gameplay of the original. It also has insight on the original game's creation if you're into that sort of thing.\nIt's a love-or-hate-it sort of experience for all. If you've never played Duke 3D, get it on sale. If you play it constantly, don't get it because you'll be complaining and that's 1/16 of the complaints we don't need in the gaming industry.", "hours": 0.6, "username": "Lotica", "products": 1202, "early_access": false},

So I did start the game with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.\nYes, you can point to the original 2-weapons limite (later patched to 4), the confused design, the odd linearity, the dated graphics, the vehicle sections, and objectively you have what could be called a bad game, or mediocre at best.\nHowever, within that mediocre game, there are still gasps of greatness.  The shrunk-down levels, particularly at Duke Burger, and unique and incredibly fun.  The vehicle sections, while not the most engaging, are sill playable.  And the first one, again shrunk down and driving an R/C car, is downright creative.  The shooting is solid, with the feel of the original Duke3D weapons maintained well throughout.  The nods to the history of the series are executed in the perfect tongue-in-cheek style.  And the Ego health system, while evocative of the Halo shield system, is still a stroke of genius.\nAnd the there's Duke.  While some may take issue with Duke getting out of breath after short sprints, or the fact that he clearly has laid off the roids since he can no longer carry the entire National Guard armory with him, it doesn't matter.  Duke Talk is still voiced by the incredible Jon St. John, and while many of the references are dated, they are dated to a time period that the target audience for the game will remember.  While the line \"I'm your huckleberry.\" won't be a reference many millenials will get, it still made me laugh out loud (possibly becuase I had watched Tombstone a scant few weeks before I played DNF).\nIt isn't a masterpiece, but in my opinion, neither was Duke3D.  Duke3D had the virtue of being the first mainstream shooter with a real protagonist, and with adult content.  The subsequent Build Engine games were better shooters (Blood and Shadow Warrior come to mind), the concurrent id titles were both mechanically better, and once Quake came out, graphically lightyears better, but Duke was the first of a new genre.  He made a strong protagonist in shooters a \"thing\", for better or for worse.\nFor me, it was worth paying for the game twice - once as a preorder, and again on Steam, just for the positives I've mentioned, and for nostalgia.\nIf you didn't play classic Duke3D at an impressionable age, it isn't likely going to be for you.

However, the quality isn't super consistent, with levels running the gamut from \"Exceeds the quality of the original game\" with thoughful, inventive and professional layouts, to \"Feels like a fan map from 1996\" that have horrific flow, very little focus and just feel amateur in comparison to what else is on offer.\nThe developer commentary would also have been a very worthwhile addition, if there was more of it. While the first level of each episode generally has a few commentary nodes smattered about which contain some really interesting insights into the development of game, later levels contain few nodes, if any at all. It does feel like a bit of a bait and switch; encouraging fans of the original to play through the game again to find new information only to be left wanting once the first level is completed.\nWhile the framerate is mostly good, as you would expect for a game that's has such a low relative complexity for modern systems, I've also encountered rather frequent framerate issues after the game has been running for 10 minutes or more. Switching out and back in to fullscreen mode with ALT+Enter seems to fix it for a short period, however.\nAnother new addition (At least to PC versions) is the timeline feature, that after death allows you to return to any point in the level, basically making quicksave-scumming an obselete tactic. However, the longer you take in a level, the more squirrelly the controls for the timeline become, with slow updates making it very difficult to pinpoint the exact point you wish to return to.\nOne thing to note for older fans of the series is that this is missing content that was available in the previous Megaton Edition of the game, that being the expansion episodes of Duke It Out In D.C., Life's A Beach and Nuclear Winter. Honestly I'm personally not particularly upset about the loss of these episodes as I found them to be bland, uninspired and tawdry affairs, but others have fonder memories of these and as such it's worth pointing out their absence.\nAll up, it's a decent package and is arguably the most definitive edition of the game for newcomers of the series, and a nice spit-shine for returning players.", "hours": 25.4, "username": "AntiPseudonym", "products": 336, "early_access": false},

Barely any trivia or insight, just them sounding bored and saying how cool the stuff on the level is. And it's only available on 2-3 levels per episode (except for E5 which is fully commentated and possibly the most interesting one).\nAnd finally, the episode 5 itself. It's good, but not worth more than $5 in my opinion. Introduces only 1 new enemy which is more annoying than anything, setting you on fire, and goes for more modern level design, with very little backtracking. The levels themselves are much larger in size, but they feel like they're borrowing from the modern-retro level design of Painkiller and Serious Sam, with loads of ammo, big arenas connected with corridoors and huge hordes of enemies from the start. Which also means almost no pacing, they're throwing Battlelords at you from the first level. Yes, the episode is harder than the previous ones, but it's not because of smart enemy placement or puzzles to figure out, but the number of enemies thrown at you at once.\nOverall I can only recommend this version if you haven't played Duke 3D at all since it's the only version available right now, though you can still find Atomic/Megaton on key reselling sites, which is a much better option.", "hours": 4.5, "username": "Elkondo", "products": 632, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false},

So when I heard that a game celebrating duke's 20th anniversary was coming out with a new episode, I was overjoyed and preordered it immediately. I wish I had put way more thought and investigating into this before doing that, because today I'm taking off my rose-colored nostalgia glasses to say this is easily the worst installment of duke 3d right now, for several reasons.\n1. The new episode (and main selling point) is kinda fun but also woefully short, and it only took me around two hours to complete it during my first time playing it. The new enemy is a crushed sprite of the assault troopers and don't do much other than be annoying, not to mention the final boss is so easy it was practically a joke to fight.\n2. A minor complaint, but the old episodes don't have anything new included in them aside from the dev commentary, which there's tons of in some areas but very little of in others. I thought a new remastered release of old content would have some new updates and changes added to all the old levels, but nope.\n3. Duke's voice is about the only thing that sounds high-def here. All the other sounds---the music, gunfire, enemies, ect.---sounds muffled beyone belief, like someone's smothering them with a pillow. It's actually pretty impressive how a re-release can actually sound worse than the original DOS version that was released 20 years ago.\n4. The game has integrated steam workshop support, but unlike the Megaton Edition, there doesn't seem to be a way to play fan-made mods and levels that you can download from duke modding websites and communities. In fact, there barely seems to be any kind of customizing at all. Nice PC options like the ability to turn off auto-aim and mouse acceleration are nonexistent here. Seriously.\n5. Easily the most unforgivable aspect of World Tour is that it has been stripped clean of Life's a Beach, Duke it out in DC, and Nuclear Winter. Whether you liked the expansions or not, that's easily half to two-thirds of the game's content missing right there, and the only feasible explanation for this is they're going to try to sell it to you as DLC later.\n6. The Megaton Edition had all the the expansion packs, customizability, and looked and played just fine, yet it was only $10. World Tour is more like a trainwreck instead of a remaster, but they want you to pay $20 for it. And just to cement that this was a blatant cash grab, they pulled the Megaton Edition out of digital stores to try to get you to buy this one, meaning if you want Megaton you're SOL unless you can find someone selling steam keys.\nI know that this review probably sounds long overdue, but there's a reason for that. For some reason steam wouldn't let me post my review of this game for several weeks and I'm not quite sure why. But in any case, I hope that one day that this game's problems get fixed, they add more new content and the lost content gets restored so I can make this a positive review. But for now, Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour is pretty much GearBox taking a whole pie that costed $10, eating all but one slice of it, then putting a stale cherry on top of said slice to try to sell it to you for $20.", "hours": 12.8, "username": "Charlie McRapekit", "products": 418, "found_funny": 6, "early_access": false},

They should have made an old school/90s FPS with intense battles, interesting weapons, and incentives to explore the levels, then add some Duke flavour to it. It should have been an instant success in an era of \"modern\" shooters in which you can just carry two guns and the levels are super linear. Legend has it that the original Duke 3D was already completed with very strong gameplay elements, and they decided to add further interactivity to the levels and the personality of Duke later on.\nSadly, the developers seemed to focus only on latter part of the Duke formula, and forgot to make an actual good game out of all this. What we got was a watered-down version of a once classic game with regenerating health, weightless combat and recycled ideas from other shooters of the time. The game is also padded with unnecessarily long turret and driving sections, which might vary up the gameplay, but this is really not what Duke is about.\nDon't get me wrong, DNF has its moments and it even has some memorable puzzles and levels. Sometimes, when you're fighting the aliens and Duke says one of his signature one-liners after dealing with a pig cop, it brings back memories, you know?

{"product_id": "434050", "page": 44, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-10-30", "text": "I highly recommend the 20th Anniversary World Tour edition of Duke Nukem 3D to any fan of this wonderful, ground-breaking 1st person shooter.  For those who are not familiar or have not played Duke Nukem 3D and like 1st person shooters, I still recommend this as after all of these years, Duke Nukem 3D still provides hours upon hours of entertainment.  Now, I will not review the game itself as Duke Nukem 3D has been reviewed a million times and most of those reviews can be still read online.  My review will be limited to this publication of this edition and will make references to previous editions.\nI think that I have probably played just about every version of this game on the PC, PS1, and Sega Saturn.  On the PC, I have played the original DOS version extensively and most (if not all) of the user ports such as Rancidmeat, JfDuke, xDuke, and eDuke.  I also own the Megaton Edition, which was removed from the Steam store last year to make room for this edition.  I own and have played all of the official Sunstrom expansion packs including Duke Carribbean and Duke it Out in DC.  I also own and have played Nuclear Winter and some of the lesser known ones like Duke Zone! II and Xtreme.  So, I think this establishes me as a seasoned player (though not necessarily an expert one).\nI am endorsing the 20th Anniversary World Tour for several reasons.  I really like the fact that the publisher (Gearbox) did not drastically modify the original game.  Essentially, the gameplay and graphics remains relatively the same, which in my view is a good thing.  The one major addition, which is fairly subtle, was a new lighting engine, which I really like and find easier on my now 45 year old eyes.  This makes the game playable on newer systems.  Another feature that I really enjoy is the fact that some of the orginal level designers were reunited and a new episode was created.  I am already through most of the new maps and can say that they are really awesome!  Some have commented that they have a linear feel to them.  I am not sure that I agree with that entirely.  The are big, expansive levels that fit in with the original game very nicely and are anything but linear in my opinion.  Lastly, I am very much enjoying the commentary by the original designers that is included.  I have learned things about the game I never knew.  This has me playing the original episodes again.\nThere is one more point I would like to make about the new episode.  I think all of us fans who played the original game back in '96 will likely describe the wonderful experience of having played this game for the first time, which one only gets to experience once.  Unlike the Megaton Edition, the 20th Anniversary World Tour allowed me to briefly experience that same sensation with a new level designed by the original level designers.  The Megaton edition did not offer any new content and thus could not provide that.  Don't get me wrong, I am not knocking the Megaton edition as it offers many features that this edition does not, which I will get into soon.  Is the new episode worth $20?  Well, that really depends on who you are.  For me, having that experience of playing something new, it was worth it and I suspect that most hardcore Duke Nukem 3D players might have a similar thought.\nThe 20th Anniversary World Tour is not without it's shortcomings.  The most obvious is the lack of expansion packs namely Life's a Beach, Duke it out in DC, and Nuclear Winter.  It is difficult to say whether this had anything to do with licensing issues or if there is some plan to release them later.  The Megaton edition has those expansions and offered the entire package at a cheaper price.  Another shortcoming is the lack of Build editor to design levels.  Of course, this is really not a huge issue for hardcore fans, because if your like me, then you can use other port tools to design your levels and them transfer them to this edition.  Still, given the cost, it would have been nice to add an updated Build tool that simplifies level design.  Perhaps, Gearbox will include that in future updates and I just need to be patient.  I guess we will see.\nWhich brings me to the sound issue.  Others have rightly called out the sound quality of this edition.  The new sound is a bit low in quality.  I am not sure what the deal is with this.  For me, this is not a huge issue and after playiing the game for several minutes, I eventually forgot about it and do not see this as a deal breaker at all.  The new voicing by Jon St. John and remastered music is pretty good and I suppose necessary for the new episodes.  So, all in all, it really balances things out in my view.\nFinally, the lack of mouse aim is the only other big negative in this edition and has rightly been pointed out in other reviews.  I sincerly hopes that Gearbox fixes this issue and soon!  In my view, this is the single largest negative to this edition.\nI see alot of potential with the 20th Anniversary World Tour.  My hope is that Gearbox will release the popular expansion packs or at least offer the ability for users like me to manually add them.  Another possibility is that Gearbox is having the designers continuing to design awesome episodes for future release via DLC, which I am willing to pay some money (say $10 per new episodes? OR some kind of season pass?).  That is my hope, but certainly I am not holding my expectations too high.  If this were combined with a updated level design editor, the 20th Anniversary World Tour would be Duke Nukem 3D fan's dream!", "hours": 43.3, "user_id": "76561198114303123", "username": "daneman20", "products": 42, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false},
{"product_id": "434050", "page": 44, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-10-28", "text": "Duke Nukem World Tour is a typical Gearbox 'Curate's Egg' of a package. It's great to have a new episode by the original level creators. Just getting Levelord out of retirement is worth the price of admission. Lee Jackson is also back, along with Jon St. John for more original music and 'Duke Talk' respectively. The new episode is not up to the quality level of the original episode, but is a fun romp none the less.\nSo, on the face of it, everything should be wonderful. Sadly, this is not all the case. Although a lot of work has gone into the production of the new episode, a lot of the other aspects of the production have had absolutely zero effort expended on them. The 'new' monster is actually an alpha version of the Liz Trooper rescued from the old 3DR vaults and pressed back into service. The end Boss is the original sprite for the Cycloid Emperor with a pallete swap. You are telling me that Gearbox couldn't find a creature artist to whip up a low-res model to make sprites from? Really?\nThe 'Can't be bothered' design philosphy extends to the artwork, which is just the original DN3D box artwork, with a new logo and now featuring even less colour. It's like they made the episode and suddenly thought \"Oh crap, we don't have any money left, here's 50 bucks to get new monsters and do the cover artwork.\"\nOne more glaring problem is the sound in the game. All the new sounds by Jon St. John sound nice and clear, but all the original Duke talk and other sounds have been improperly coded, so they sound muffled . The two sounds together are terrible. I can't believe that this was OK'd by quality control, or even that it passed XBox or Playstation certification. Seriously, what the hell Gearbox?\nI don't know if they let the Janitor produce this or what. I imagine that years from now there will be some epic tale of fail that will eventually come to light about how this was allowed to happen. Till then, we are sitting here scratching our heads as to how three quarters of the project was good, and one quarter would be laughed off of Steam as being below the standard of quality of a low-level mod.\nSo to sum up, Worth it (IMHO) for the new episode, but with loads of points deleted for whoever at Gearbox went to lunch instead of doing their job.", "hours": 7.8, "user_id": "76561197974847980", "username": "Tea Monster", "products": 114, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false},

For perspective, this is the same price as the 90s add-on that added a new episode and no bells or whistles.\nAs a long time Duke fan, I was actually impressed with what I received. The most underrated feature is the new rendering engine. I was shocked at how much this new engine made the old levels beautiful without taking away from the original feel of the graphics. I used to play Duke 3D with the fan-made High-Resoution Pack. Now I prefer the World Tour Edition version.\nThe new levels are fun too. They feature lots of (reused) bosses, which I enjoy because it adds a new type of challenge to the game. The new enemy type and new weapon also add variety to gameplay that feels more significant than was the case with Episode 4 in the 90s.\nThe price may seem steep to you for an old game, but remember, you're buying the entire game, plus its first addon, plus a new addon, plus a new engine and new features for modern hardware.\nThe only drawback to this game as must be acknowledged is that there is yet to be any obvious ability to make it compatable with the 3 un-official expansions from the Megaton Edition. I own Duke it Out in DC, and it's a solid set of levels. Hopefully Gearbox adds a way to include those levels, particularily if they've already been purchased in some form.\nI understand the fan outcry about the removal of Megaton Edition and its replacement with this game, but I honestly feel this is the best move for Duke Nukem 3D.

Legacy voice can be activated in the options menu.\n- When you die, you can restart the level at any point (like a time machine). It's a nice feature.\n- EDIT: Nice gimmick: Some Maps contain developer commentaries :) (Can be turned on in the options menu)\nCons:\n- If you like smoother graphics, the Megaton texture filtering looks smoother (but no light effects)\n- Sound quality is more muffled than in the original, why ever. But while playing, it didn't really matter to me.\n- Too expensive atm ($20 WTF? ... I was drunk when I bought it)\nI own both newer versions, Megaton and this one. I prefer the 20th Anniversary World Tour edition. New maps, better speech, cool light effects and of course a whole new Episode from the original map creator!

{"product_id": "434050", "page": 47, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-10-17", "text": "Duke Nukem is a long standing franchise that saw its start in the 2D action-platformer genre with both its 1991 and 1993 releases. After the success of series' such as Doom and Wolfenstein, Duke saw himself reincarnated into the 3D world of then-modern shooters in 1996 with Duke Nukem 3D; the third installment in the series. Much later into its lifespan, the Megaton Edition of the game was released in 2013, and it included both the Atomic Edition of Duke Nukem 3D, along with Manhattan Project.\nI'll start out by saying two very important things: Yeah, Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour isn't as good as the Megaton Edition. Yeah, people (fanboys in particular) are blowing it way out of proportion. The removal of the Megaton version of Duke Nukem 3D was not malicious or part of a grand scheme for Gearbox to make more money. They didn't even have the distribution rights to the Megaton Edition; Devolver Digital did, and their distribution agreement ended in early 2016. It was only after this LEGALLY BINDING distribution agreement ended that Gearbox Publishing took over. Some people here really need to do more research before bashing a company for something they didn't do.\nI love Duke Nukem as much as the next guy who enjoys fast action, big explosions, slaughtering aliens, and tipping hot strippers to see their pixelated boobs. That being said, I'm no fanboy to the series and this review will probably be the most unbiased one that you'll read here. There are a plethora of downsides to the 20th Anniversary World Tour if you're comparing it to the Megaton Edition, so let's just get those out of the way. This version does not come with all of the \"extras\" that Megaton did, such as Duke It Out in D.C., Duke: Nuclear Winter, Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach, or the classic version of the game. Additionally the sound, particularly the music, seems a lot more muffled in juxtaposition.\nThose two aforementioned downers are the only problems, though, and they could easily be fixed by Gearbox with free DLC and a patch to fix the sound. There's actually a lot that the 20th Anniversary World Tour does very well. For one, there's a nice lighting and visual upgrade. Long gone is the semi-disorienting skybox that didn't quite move properly when looking up at it; there's now real depth perception in terms of the skyline, and it doesn't look boxy anymore. A lot of the level textures have had a pretty solid upgrade as well. You can even see the contrast by switching between modes on the fly in-game without having to pause by pressing the C key.\nA lot of people are angry about the new Duke Nukem voice-overs, because that's another new feature in this edition of the game. Simply put, if you don't like the high-definition version, you can go back to \"retro Duke\" in the options menu. I personally don't feel like Jon St. John sounds \"tired\" and \"exhausted\" with his voice acting, as others have mentioned. I did a lot of comparisons by saving before a one-liner and then reloading and listening to it with retro Duke turned on; most of it (so far) sounds the exact same. Even if he does sound a little tired to some, he's earned the right... he's nearly 60 years old for god sake; 20 years have passed since he first voiced Duke.\nOnto the game itself. If you've never played Duke Nukem 3D, you're missing out on a spectacular experience. With what little story there is available, the events pick up right where Duke Nukem II left off; Duke returns to Los Angeles in his space cruiser, but before he can land his ship is shot down by unknown hostiles. As he's sending out a distress signal, Duke discovers that aliens are attacking his home city. They've even mutated the LAPD. As such, you go on a violent rampage of alient assassination in order to stop the invasion.\nThe gameplay itself is very similar to Doom, in that you have to collect keycards to open new doors to progress through the levels. However, Duke Nukem features a never-ending supply of enemies that respawn, so you can't get comfortable for long no matter where you are. There are a multitude of weapons, by the way the weapon selection has been revamped in the 20th Anniversary World Tour... another plus side, health and ammo pick-ups, and steroids that send Duke into a high octane killing frenzy. The secrets in each level are also much harder to find, opposed to those in say Wolfenstein 3D, and you get a real fulfilled sense when you end up stumbling into one.\nNow, the deluxe feature of Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour is that it comes with a fifth episode that was crafted by the original episode designers. I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but yes it's worth buying this game just to play the new episode. Can you still buy Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition? In some places, yes. Is it cheaper than the 20th Anniversary World Tour? Sure is, for now. Which one should you buy? It really doesn't matter, the real question you should be asking yourself is whether or not you want to experience a new, killer episode or revisit multiple expansion packs. Either way, aside from some audio issues, Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour is a solid re-re-release of one of the best early shooters that has a kickass attitude all its own.\nThe Horror Network\n|\nClick for Gore", "hours": 1.6, "username": "The Horror Network", "products": 2987, "early_access": false},

Now that im older and obviously more understanding (durp) i have decided to purchase the game again and so far im in the third episode. story wise it really isnt much...duke must save the wrold from a alien invasion...thats pretty much it..and also prevent earths many babes from being turned into whatever they are being turned into (yes i have gotten into the alien nest areas and i assume the women are being used to create alien children?) its pretty much classic old duke like many of you have come to know and love and honestly i now know why many like the game so much. yes its one of those games that was obviously captilizing of the FPS craze in the 90's Doom had created (and yes i played Doom when i was young to but like duke 3D, never beat it until i got older) but its the overal gameplay and exploritive aspect of the game that makes it so fun. yes the difficutly settings are there to make it harder and more drawn out but its the idea of 100% the levels and finding all the secrets. so far i know i havnt found all the secets but i do know that i have found a good chunk collectivly across all the levels i have played; is it good? yes.\nnow for the removal of megaton edtion: this isnt going to affect the review but i honeslty find it a bit disheartening that megaton edtion was removed and replaced with a version that are only exclusive to this version alone. yes its the same game and missing some bonus levels wont exactly hurt but its the fact you must pay another $20 for the game again even if you already own megaton edtion (assuming duke nukem 3D megaton edtion was also $20).\ni know this is gearbox's property and they can do whatever they want with it even if people dont like it but it wouldnt have been bad to at least give people half off this game who owned megaton edtion. like i said they dont have to but it would have been nice.", "hours": 8.4, "username": "TMAC Blade", "products": 186, "early_access": false},

Below i'll list some points on how I think this game came out as both a new chapter and a port of the first 4 chapters.\nNote: I haven't tried the multiplayer yet so none of my points will have to do with the multiplayer.\nPros\n-New levels are pretty good.\n-New duke quotes and jokes in new levels are very funny\n-New recordings of all duke quotes (can be disabled)\n-New music is cool\n-Dev commentary (definetly worth trying)\n-New incenerator weapon is fun and powerful.\n-Rewind system from the XBLA port is here and fun.\n-Workshop implemented very well and fun to experiment.\n-Seems like some glitches were patched.\nCons\n-Every sound other than the new duke quotes sound so compressed. It's impossible not to hear.\n-Lacking a lot of graphical and visual options\n-New levels don't have the same exploration value (can't open every locker like in other chapters)\n-Levels have tons of enemies in small areas instead of scattering them around\n-Final boss of new chapter is a joke. Way too easy.\n-New enemies do a ton of damage and are really hard to kill. (can get frustrating)\n-None of the other expansions (like Life's A Beach)\n-Megaton edition was removed? Why? That had all of the expansions!\n-New lighting is extremely drastic and too dark at times (while light sources go straight through walls)\n-No secret levels in the new chapter. (Not a big con, but notable)\n-New Duke quotes sound kind of lame. Doesn't sound like he's trying much at all .\n-It's very weird hearing the compressed audio next to the high quality theme and duke talk.\n-I believe the new music uses motifs of older songs. Meaning it re-uses the melodies in the new songs. This is cool and all but I feel like the music relies too much on these motif's. Either way it is cool to hear a song and recognize it from an earlier chapter.\nAgain, I believe this replaced Megaton edition. If you didn't get Megaton edition, i'm sorry, this is an inferior port of the game (even though it's the only way to play the new chapter)\nFinal Thoughts:\nAs an long time duke fan, this was a lot of fun to play. Although inferior to the megaton edition, I had a lot of fun with the dev commentary and hearing them talk about some of the moments from the game. It's like walking around a museum but playing a game.\nAfter playing for a while I didn't notice the compressed sound (except when breaking trash cans).\nIf you're a classic duke fan, I'd recommend this game. If you're not a classic duke fan, I'd consider looking for a different version of duke 3d. But it's not that bad. If the game is bumped down to 15 or 10 i'd say everyone could have fun with this game.", "hours": 10.0, "username": "MullyWhizz", "products": 235, "early_access": false},

World Tour doesn't seem to have mod support, like it does in Megaton Edition. i was able to play some Duke mods back in the Megaton port with no real issues at all. but trying it for World Tour seems to not work. i'm bummed that i couldn't be able to use the DNF Gloves mod from Megaton onto World Tour, but i'll let that slide. maps you get from the workshop have some kinks to it really. some won't seem to work unless you got true 3d lighting on, otherwise you'll get a cluster of an error message. and you can't seem to download a usermap when you're joining a lobby. otherwise it'll just take you to Hollywood Holocaust and give ya some kinda error message from there. and the last con thing that i have, is that the expansions weren't added into World Tour. Megaton Edition had the main game, as well as the expansions. and the expansions were finally made to be multiplayer friendly. overall though, i enjoyed Duke Nukem 3D: World Tour, and i enjoyed the new episode. if a new Duke game ever gets made, i hope they use what they did here to still give it the Duke Nukem 3D feel to it", "hours": 40.7, "username": "MrRumbleRoses", "products": 430, "early_access": false},

Like everyone else, I can't believe they left out the add ons (Life's a Beach and Duke It out in DC, etc). but I am glad that I have the Megaton edition for that.\nThe real negative, in my opinion, is the overall sound quality.  I can't honestly believe that the game makers did not have higher fidelity sound effects on file, and should have been able to bring those up to date as well.  Or, they should have put all new sound FX in and then allow the user to mix between new and old ones, etc.  The problem with the way it  now is that you have such a mix in sound quality:  super low rez and muffled (machine gun, etc), medium quality (droids and shotgun), and then normal fidelity for the redo of Duke's voice.  The mix of these is very odd and sort of jarring at first, and took me some time to get used to.  You can switch back to the classic sounds of course, but ehh...\nAs for the updated Duke voicings, I think Jon St John did a great job.  No, he doesn't sound exactly like his previous self, but who would after 20 years and I certainly don't expect Jon to try to sound exactly the same.  In fact, I kind of see it as a joke that Duke is revisiting his past adventures with a more \"mature\"/experienced attitude.  At the end of the day, I could personally listen to Jon do the voicing of Duke all day and be thoroughly entertained by it, but that's just me.\nThe rewind feature sucks and takes a lot of getting used to.  I am not sure what advantage this has over just saving/reloading, but whatever.  The weapon switching is not very smooth for some odd reason.  When you scroll the mouse wheel, it brings up blocky imagess of your inventory, but it doesn't always seem to select what you want.  I found hitting the 1-9 keys to work better.\nFrom a stability standpoint, some people have reported crashes, but so far either I have been lucky or the program has been otherwise stable for me and I've had no issues.\nAt the end of the day, I don't think this is really worth $20.  Somehow, I can't help but feel Duke deserved better after 20 years.  At the very least, Megaton Edition owners should have gotten half off or something, so unless you are a diehard fan I would suggest waiting for a sale.", "hours": 5.4, "user_id": "76561197970482328", "username": "fjk1138", "products": 313, "early_access": false},

Speaking of looking up or down, it can now be played more like a modern shooter, with aiming done by mouse and WASD to move, the usual crap. That said, these alterations can be turned off in the options so you can play full classic style if you can't accept that Gearbox might be trying to keep Duke alive by giving his games some much needed TLC. Plebs like myself can now just play the game instead of having constant trouble with the classic controls.\nA massively unnecessary addition is the re-done lines.

It is like playing a whole new game.\nPeople are saying that duke sounds \"bored\" , or that he isnt as clenched and gritty as the original recordings. I disagree. Jon St Jon himself said that due to his creative personality he can be more relaxed and have more freedom in voicing Duke Nukem. This is an AWESOME re-recording and a love letter to anyone who likes FPS games.\nThe games has a WHOLE NEW EPISODE, thus making it NOT A REMAKE! It is an awesomely ported , fast paced, TRUE GAME THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE PLAYED FOR MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES BEFORE BEING BORED LIKE IN SH**TY HALO.\nYou can interact with several new objects, and I will not spoil what they are in this review.\nBUY THIS GAME! BUY IT NOW! You can tour the world in the new episode, spanning from San Francisco to Russia.\nThere is an option to turn off the overhauled EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE engines bells and whistles if you wish, and play duke nukem in its original pixel glory. THIS surpasses original release, and is more that worth buying , with enough content to keep you busy FOREVER! This game will never get old, and if you are a true FPS gamer you will agree. If not, turn on your SH**TY ******* XBOX and play halo, then go screw yourself.\nI added that Xbox line as a extra one liner and no no offense to xbox fans....OH , speaking of xbox, YOU CAN USE THE XBOX CONTROLLER and it is ALREADY pre-programmed and ready to use in duke.\nSorry if you take offense to this review, but this game kicks some sereous *** and should be played by all of mankind, and womankind for that matter. It is my most prized purchase of the year, and I feel like it is the 90's again, except MODERN and more , MUCH MORE content than previous releases.\nI hope they throw in the other expansions for free, as it does not include duke it out in dc, and the other two add on expansions. But who cares because the enw episode is AMAZING.\nOn a last note you can factor in replay value.

That is, what if some old map designers made new maps or a new game today. I was already thrilled about Romero's Doom maps, so I was curious what the two Duke 3D map designers would do today. That's why I bought this game, and it's true 20 bucks for additional episode on a dated game is a bit too much. Yet, there are some interesting changes that makes it worth for me. First, it's the audio commentary (which unfortunatelly seems to exist so far only in the first map of every episode but there are plenty of them). Then, new voice overs, which however sound a bit off (I cringe especially with \"where is it?\" sample when I push the walls). Then the special effects, ambient occlusion, a bit better lighting, a new flamethrower weapon and annoying flame throwing enemy and boss, a lot of new textures and level settings (even though lowres).\nI mean, I am kinda mixed, but I personally enjoy replaying the game, listening to the commentaries and playing the new maps. Now, the new maps, so far felt a bit,.. very well detailed, funny new themes and jokes, some of the best scenery in Duke 3D. BUT.. the feel more linear. At least half of the levels I played (I stopped on the egypt level so far). And that's what I was curious of. Will the old creators do oldschool interconnected levels? Will they follow modern design sensibilities of simplifying things? Why? Why everything goes there? The first level is full of scenery but extremely linear, uses however the portal trick somewhere to confuse you so there are few interesting tidbits, but if you put it down you wonder why?\nLater levels become bigger, but filled too early with big boss enemies (those huge hitscanners that made build engine games annoying compared to Doom) but it's ok except from a final boss in church level where there is not enough space and I die constantly (where I discovered the interesting rewind function, an interesting feature, yet it made possible to rewind and win, albeit after many tries, kinda making it pointless/casual). Many times you open a door with the red key, to find a small room with the yellow key for example, while it should be open the red door to discover a brand new area, where you had to search for the yellow key. It's very much open the door to hand you plainly the next key. Why? I haven't found a very interconnected level like in the old Duke3D, Blood, Doom and anything, makes me wonder why? It kinda solve my question what would happen if old designers were to make new levels again. Would they succumb into linear holding hands levels (although at least the difficulty and fun remains the same because enemies and shooting and moving is exactly the same)? Now I kinda see it (hopefully it gets better in future level, but I DNKROZed (which became DNGOD, why?) the final holywood level and it ends up being quite small and linear and not enough space with the final boss. I would replay the old classic maps and make some comparisons as I go along.\nYet, I feel like recommending this one, because I had great fun with the shooting and player movement and the enemy responsed I got used to, it just plays like the old one well, the new levels have the scenery and atmosphere but not the complexity of design or size, and the commentaries are very interesting historically even if they do not exist in every level in the classics. Some stuff are good, it's not all that bad, but I still question why we can never get the map complexity of the old classic FPS even when veterans come back (I am really curious what Romero is going to do with the other new FPS, really).\nAlso, maybe wait for the price to drop. 10$ or less would be a definite Yes from me, now it's a light one.", "hours": 9.1, "user_id": "76561198016926002", "username": "BugoTheCat", "products": 347, "early_access": false},

It is a n ice interesting original feature I have not seen anywhere other than on the xbox 360 port of duke nukem but it makes the game much easier, fortunately you can turn if off if you want to play the game the way it was made to be played when you die if you didn't save back to the start of the level pistol start.\nCons\n1  The biggest issue here is that they removed the atomic edition, the megaton edition and I have not checked the console ports of duke nukem but it seems that due to license issues nobody can buy duke nukem anymore other than this version of the game. and the issues with that are if you owned say megaton edition and you wanted new players to join and play death match with you they cant buy the game on steam anymore. If you wanted to play the 3 bonus expansions that came with the megaton editon, duke it out in DC, life's a beach, and nuclear winter, you cant buy those anymore. I will call this for what it is very very anti-consumer, they should have dealt with the legal issues so that we can play as many versions of duke nukem as possible not remove a great game from sale.\n2  The multiplayer seems to be just like megaton edtions mutiplayer on steam and that means peer to peer networking making it stable but often very lagy empty and dead. I have played the game around launch and I could hardly get a good match going. I feel like megaton had better mutiplayer somehow despite as far as I can tell it is the exact same. They should have improved it better.\n3 The game has no Linux, Mac support, I have had technical issues like if I move to fast into a crowded room the game will slow down asif I was playing this on a console. I have played the xbox 360 version of the game and I don't remember it lagging in single player like that, the multipalyer is also laggy as well.\n4 The sound. Now john saint john did wonderful voice acting despite his age, and that is not my issue here, the issue is the games sound effects, and music sound worse than the original duke 3D did if you spent time getting it too work well. It also has worse sound than the megaton edition and it sounds very muffled. I think it should have the options between old and new sound effects, music and johns voice of duke.\nTo conclude, the game is great playing it very very fun, it has some features better than eduke32, megaton, and those other ways of playing the game have advantages over this version. The port of the game itself works perfectly fine if you ask me I played megaton before playing this port and after a bit of configuration I didn't notice any difference in how the game ran controlled and felt but it needs work in a few areas. The game hopefully has a better build engine and might be able to run better more detailed maps than the megaton version could but I have yet to see it. I found this game really really hard to recommend for 21.99 dollars but the game was well marketed, it is duke nukem and it is not something I did not want like duke nukem forever was and I really really like duke nukem it is my favorite game to play in death match so I do have a bit of a nostalgia bias.\nDo I recommend you buy this game? If you do not already own the megaton edition  and you have hardly or never played duke nukem before I recommend it 100%. But if you own megaton edition and any other ports of duke nukem and you already got 500 kills in death match, beat 4 or more episodes then I don't recommend it. If you use Mac or Linux you cant seem to run the game,but I see quality here the levels are very well made a man who legally named himself the levellord and other duke devs made levels for the game the humor is still intact and the game is hard and fun. I do overall these many issues recommend it to you. I would say it is worth 21.99 dollars and it is totally worth it on sale.", "hours": 31.4, "user_id": "76561198103591851", "username": "likejagger5", "products": 426, "early_access": false},

Go buy DOOM 2016 or Wolfenstein: TNO, or heck even the old Duke Nukems hold up far better. Do not subject yourself to how poor this title is. You're better than this.\nI went into this game having heard all the awful things people have said about it over the last 6 years. Yet, I was still shocked at how terrible the experience of playing this game was. Steam puts that my playtime (on hard mode) at 6.7hrs, i'll round it down to 6hrs as I went AFK a bit but dear lord it felt like I had played this game for 10+ easy, it was a chore to finish.\nI have lot to say about how poor the game was, but i'll keep it short - the fundamental gameplay of this game is simply not well designed, nor fun. Enemies (of which there are probably 8? 2 of which you'll fight a majority of the time over and over again) are gigantic bullet sponges, who - especially on half difficulty - will dish out a stupid amount of damage. Couple this with gunplay that is incredibly lacking in any form of feedback and you have an FPS that from the get go simply isnt fun to play. Guns arent satisfying to shoot, the sounds lack depth and animations are basic and the enemies reactions to getting hit are something like Goldeneye 64 with some mild flinching. There also seemed to be a strange inconsistency with damage a weapon could deal which never quite made sense.\nCouple this with -\n- Boring level design - which essentially drops off about halfway through and the game starts to feel extreme filled with 'filler content' as you do the same thing over and over and levels seem uncessary long.\n- Awful boss fights - same as with the basic enemies, theyre bulletsponges which you keep shooting till they die (usually with a QT event to break up the stages) they also seem to have only ever hit you twice, once you put you on 1hp and the next to finish - this isnt saying theyre hard because theyre not, they are just strangely unforgiving and tiring to verse as a a single sidestep will kill you.\n- Simply bad writing. I get it, Duke is a relic of times passed and people will constantly defend this games poor writing and awful humor as being 'delightfully cheesy' but the issue is that this type of humor done better in other games (heck Bulletstorm released the same damn year and was ticked the same 'macho-man' theme whilst also having superior gameplay..). It realies so heavily on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t memes and just an overall reliance on the audience expecting to enjoy the most basic of sexual innuendos.\n- Poor graphics for 2011 (BF3, Crysis 2, Deus Ex, MW3, Dark Souls... these are the games that released alongside this.)\nI'd personally struggle to say anything good about this game. It was truly an awful experience from start to finish that I forced myself to complete simply so I can say I did and add some validity to this review. If you enjoyed it - good for you,  i'm glad you had a good time.", "hours": 6.7, "username": "Mother Beef", "products": 276, "early_access": false},

Well it surpassed my expectations.  Its like the game has a brand new coat of paint which makes it look amazing.  Don't like the new graphics?  Well no worries cause you can turn them off in game with a press of a button in game.  Choice is always a good thing.  The default mouse senitivity is kinda off, so you may have to play around with it, but once you do,  it becomes just as twitchy as you would like it.  The only thing you can't mess with as far as I know are the updated voice of Duke.  That's gonna be personal preference if you like it or not.  Last thing is that the gamepad support is amazing!   huge problem from the Megaton Edtion is that Duke was always in run mode while playing with a game pad.  This time,  you have to press a button to run while moving.  What if you like to always run?  Its cool cause you can toggle run mode with no worries.  Again choice is a great thing.\nThe only problem I see is switching weapons seems to be bugged cause somtimes it just won't switch.  If you switch weapons the old fashion way using the 1-6 buttons on your keyboard, your fine.

This remaster is the best looking version of the game, and doesn't alter the original aside from some new sounds and prettier visuals. This is a good thing, but why do I not give it a \"recommended\" rating?\n1. The options menu is very sparse, and eduke has much more customizability and is FREE!\n2, This ties into the first one, and it might be nitpicking but there isn't even an option to turn off the auto-aim! Sure I know that's how most of the 90's fps games are but if I'm paying $20 for a 20 year old game the least you could do is let me turn off auto-aim because IMHO auto-aim is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. It's not an engine issue either, BLOOD runs off the build engine and auto-aim can be disabled by screwing with the config file.\n3. There is NO option in the menu to play user maps, and instead we have workshop integration. While workshop is cool and all  but I might want to play a map off the net.\n4. The developer commentary feels kind of half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's cool to listen to the devs but it isn't present in all levels. And they seem to have even screwed up by putting a commentary track from the new episode 5 into level 1. Might have been intentional but it feels weird when they talk about new content in the first minute.\n5. The biggest fault with this version is the absense of the expansion packs. They were included with the Megaton version of the game (that gearbox had removed). So unless you resort to the \"under-the-router\" method of aquiring them you are out of luck. The expansions are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get physically.\nSome people complain about the new re-recorded voice work but I think it's more jarring than anything. I wouldn't say that it's actually terrible but it's bizarre if you are familiar with the old game. John says the same things, but he is trying to differentiate them from the old ones by saying them differently.\nSo I would tell you to wait and see if they update this in the future before you buy it. It isn't a terrible version, just subpar as of right now.  If you have never played Duke3d before this might be worth it, but it is pretty easy to find the game physically. Just make sure you get the Atomic edition of the game and download Eduke32.  Your only other option is to *COUGH* ARRRRRGH! *COUGH* the game from you-know-where.  Gearbox had the atomic edition removed from GOG's store, so unless you bought the game beforehand you are out of luck if you are planning on legally buying another edition digitally.\nEDIT: Someone in the comment section says you can still buy Megaton keys.Some online key vendors are still selling them but I don't know if they will work or not.", "hours": 2.4, "user_id": "76561198135546620", "username": "The Idiot", "products": 572, "found_funny": 7, "early_access": false},

Absolutely no way to rebind extra mouse buttons, you're restricted to customizing only left mouse, right mouse, scroll up, scroll down, and middle mouse click through drop down menus. If you stick with Mouse_button 4 and 5 for shooters like I do, you're out of luck. Why is it that shooters from the late 90s very easily accomidate for extra mouse buttons but this game doesn't?\nThe in-game audio is absolutely terrible quality. I can see how you can get used to it after a while, but not when you're constantly being reminded with the newly recorded Jon St. John voice lines (you can turn them off by the way which is good, even though I'd love to enjoy them) that everything that's not the new lines is terribly compressed and downsampled garbage audio that can really hurt your ears.\nI didn't play too much of this before turning it off in outrage and honestly I really didn't have to to conclude that Megaton Edition was far better in almost every way except for the addition of a new graphics system (which is admittedly nice to look at but, you guessed it, no FOV slider so you're stuck looking through a tiny FOV) and new commentary (though the commentary, as I could see, is just Gearbox employees and not all of the actual developers of the orginal Duke 3D game).\nAlso there's mouse acceleration with no option to turn off.\nAnd it's also missing the three extra episodes (Duke It Out In D.C, Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach, and Duke: Nuclear Winter) that were included with the now removed from Steam Duke 3D Megaton Edition. So that's already a huge downside.\nThis is downright terrible, the negitives hugely outweigh the positives and new content of the game, especially when the downsides impact your enjoyment of even moving around as Duke.\nIf you have the Megaton Edition and debating on buying this version, don't even bother. And consider yourself lucky while you're at it. Gearbox's move of removing the Megaton Edition off of Steam to make way for this abomination is absolutely dispicable, though I've sadly come to expect that of Gearbox.\nI can only hope they patch out all of the mouse issues and actually optimize the darn game for PC players, fix the audio, and add in the previously available extra episodes as free DLC in the future, or else I cannot recommend this version of Duke 3D.

That being said, now that I've played it - I do highly recommend this game if you're a fan of Duke Nukem 3D.\nI've been playing Duke Nukem 3D for fifteen years and I've purchased the original, Atomic Edition, Kill-A-Ton Edition, Megaton Edition - pretty much whatever bundle or version has been available to me. I've played using the High Resolution Pack through it's evolution, I've played the famous Roch maps, I've made a terrible set of maps with the original build tool, you name it. I followed the progress of Duke Nukem 3D: Reloaded with great anticipation and was sad when I heard the plug had been pulled. I'd always wanted to see what a remake of Duke Nukem 3D would look like given all the technological advancements that have been made since it's release. When I first heard about the Anniversary World Tour, I assumed the \"True 3D\" they mentioned would be something like that. When I saw the trailer and realized this was not the case, I was disappointed. I was more disappointed to learn that the Megaton Edition had been pulled from the steam store when it was much cheaper and featured a whole host of extra (fan-made, but highly acclaimed) content, including two additional episodes.\nMy first instinct was to think \"that's a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥move\", selling something for a significantly higher price with less content, as you'll see is a common complaint in the bad reviews here. I mean, I could justify the price increase if it was actually a remake like Reloaded was supposed to be, but it looked to me like it was just the same old Duke with fancy lighting from the trailer. I preordered the game still, given there would be additional content from some of the original creators (such as the eight new levels and accompanying music tracks). I've always been a sucker for more Duke Nukem 3D content.\nRelease day has come and I held my breath and gave it a whirl. I played a bit, flicked on some of the old cheat codes to warp between levels and places to sus the entire game out and I have to say: I really regret doubting this release. It's beautiful. The lighting in the new engine is a great addition to the game, making old levels seem a bit more lively and making the new levels look stunning. On top of that, all of Duke's comments and vocal SFX have been re-recorded faithfully to the original with amazing clarity. If you don't like either of these options, you can turn them off and have the game look exactly as you remember.\nThe new content is well worth the price on it's own. All of the classic music is available in the traditional MIDI format and also in OGG format, recorded with hardware specified by the composer. It's not as clear as the SC-55 pack that was available for eDuke and (I think) included with the Megaton Edition, but it's on par (and I can't help but enjoy hearing tracks the way the composer wanted me to hear them). There are also nine additional tracks, available only in the OGG format. They're all faithful to the original contributions Jackson made to the soundtrack. The new levels are absolutely huge. I remember when I first played the original release, I always wanted large, outdoor levels and this release has finally made that a reality. Their locations are incredibly varied (from Pyramids to the Golden Gate bridge, to an epic return to Hollywood in the finale), and combining the vast, gigantic landscapes with the new soundtrack with the new levels gives them a larger-than-life feel, If you were around to experience the joy of getting the Plutonium Pak and \"The Birth\" as a new episode for Duke way back in the day - this new episode will give you that same feeling. Without spoiling anything pertinent, there are also a new type of enemy, a new weapon and a new (but somewhat familiar) final boss whose setting really feels like a good climax to the game.\nThe menu is swift and easy to navigate and you can select any level to begin it (except for secret levels) rather than starting each episode from the first level. Other than that, it's a bit lacking. There's no Anti-Aliasing (which in this day and age is a pretty big thing to leavel out), although you can force a form of post-aa (FXAA, SMAA, MLAA) in your respective AMD or NVIDIA control panel. There's no anisotropic filtering option either, though in this game that's not a very noticable exclusion. You can redefine your controls, but by default they're set to the mouse and keyboard setup most modern first-person-shooters use and there's no quick toggle to the original DOS controls, which is a bit of a shame. I do think the new setup is easier to use and more practical, but something about Duke Nukem 3D makes me want to use the A key to jump, not to move left. It's a minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless. Additionally, the sound effects sound much more muffled on this particular release than any other, and that is particularly noticable with the new high-fidelity recordings of Duke.\nAnyway, I've probably missed some points here and there but the game itself is definitely a good investment whether you're new to Duke Nukem 3D or a veteran like myself.

{"product_id": "57900", "page": 55, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-08-15", "text": "It would be easy to label Duke Nukem Forever as a bad game when it was released as well as in the present landscape when we have more true-to-form old-school FPSs like the Rise of the Triad Remake, DOOM (2016), and to lesser extents, the Serious Sam Games, Painkiller, and the Shadow Warrior reboot. If you examine it on its own as a modern-take on old-school FPS games, it's mediocre at best--and that is if you include The Doctor Who Cloned Me and PC version.\nAt its core, DNF is not faithful to the old-school FPS design philosophy; instead, it chooses to redefine Duke Nukem 3D in a modern age as well as reinterpreting what made the Build Engine so appealing to many people. The problem is with these changes they have removed too much complexity from the classic, and it’s only with the update on PC that added four-weapon slots and the Doctor Who Cloned Me comedic value that the game comes something beyond mediocrity.\nIf you recall the infamous moment from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare of “Press F to Pay Respects”, then the problem of modern games like Duke Nukem Forever reinterpreting the interactivity in games becomes much clearer. As video-games have become more complicated in narrative, visuals, AI, etc. they have often forgotten to add the same complexity into actions, which on face-value shows simplistic it is for the creators to make a character express a complex action through telling them what to do and how to feel. That is ultimately the flawed foundation that DNF has built itself from.\nWhat made the original Duke Nukem 3D games was not his character himself but rather how his character was expressed through the gameplay, and more importantly, the Build Engine. The Build Engine is perhaps the real cornerstone of Duke Nukem 3D more than Duke Nukem himself, and it’s what led to the beloved icons such as Lo Wang in Shadow Warrior and Caleb from Blood. It wasn’t the level-complexity and character of their weaponry that gave them life but more so how the engine allowed for a sandbox appeal with the levels from messing around with pinball machines, remote control devices, and small puzzles and secrets utilizing the open-ended levels of these games. Interactions worked alongside the combat, exploration and playfulness of these games that make them hold up to today’s standards because of how enjoyable it is to play these levels to find all its rewards.\nDNF understands this well enough that it focuses exclusively on the interactivity as a reward for the player rather than making it a means of expression embedded with the level-design itself. At first, moments like the RC control puzzle harkens back to the same usage in Shadow Warrior Classic as it becomes a part of the exploration, yet the game slowly ditches these gimmicks to funnel the player through these arena-fights given ammo-boxes before each major encounter with only a few interactable means given in vehicle sections and non-combat areas.  As much as people complain about the EGO-meter and the way you increase it with fiddling with objects as small rewards, the concept does retain DN3D’s ideas behind them with more fleshed out mini-games than the simple press E to find secrets. However, the problem is not how these “secrets” are handled but how they are separated from the level design, resource management and enemy placement to add more character to the levels.\nWhile combat was a major aspect of the original, DNF takes away all the complexity of scavenging for resources and the ability to create levels encouraging the usage of the player’s arsenal. Even with regenerating health, which isn’t as much of a problem as the original DN3D and DOOM games encouraged players to pop-and-shoot from corners for certain enemies/encounters, the design could have benefited had they not limited the player’s weaponry and streamlined ammo conservation into a minor inconvenience that is solved not by finding supplies but rather supply boxes. DOOM (2016), while having traditional health that can be refilled as quickly as regen health from its glory kills, shows that changes to the health systems do not have to be detriment of the old-school experience.\nBefore the Doctor Who Cloned Me update, players were limited to a two-weapon system which encouraged ignoring the more interesting, gimmick weapons like the Shrink Ray in favor of the weapons that provided more utility such as the Shotgun and Rocket Launcher combination. As someone who likes the idea of a two-weapon limit for certain games, such as Max Payne 3, there are games in which it hampers the gameplay to a fault. This decision mainly affected the practicality of the Freeze Ray, the new alien weapons, and left the weapons like the Ripper and the Railgun options for long-range fights provided there were ammo-boxes near the player. With the update, however, the player can make battles more engaging by having these extraneous weapons add more character to every fight and not rely on the same strategy in every engagement.\nWhat cannot be redeemed is the simplicity of the level-design that is designed around a set-path forward with cutscenes and closed arenas for combat. Although the comparison is more of a parody than the actual game, the infamous 1993 vs 2010 level design comparison has some merit in the case of the two Duke Nukem games:\n. Even in the cases of outside environments and the vehicle sections, the areas are more set-paths forward with an occasional puzzle to turn the player around to throw barrels to shift the weight for a typical seesaw and valve turning puzzle. If you can excuse this setback of what is a major part of the experience, then getting DNF with the DLC at a steep discount can be enjoyed for what it offers as it still plays as action-packed as the original with its own quirks and interesting levels like the crane area and the Duke Burger action-figure size level that reminds me of the spectacle found in Prey (2006).\nIt’s somewhat fitting that the storyline of Duke Nukem Forever casts him as a character out of place with modern times as far as him being a cultural icon in-game with all his fame proceeding his actions as the other characters criticize his heroics. As a character who began as a conglomeration of ‘80s/’90s action heroes, the set-up is fitting to make a game that works off his comedy as a trope himself. This is perhaps why I enjoyed The Doctor Who Cloned Me because it returns to the appeal of The Birth expansion of DN3D by having Dr. Protos Return with movie/game tie-ins to the level design and focusing on the comedy that pokes fun at the tropes like himself.\nAs a result of this one expansion that is somewhat shorter than the main experience, it’s easy to see how DNF could have been a great game for what it is had it been in the hand of more competent, committed developers, not outsourced to various developers with their own ideas. Unfortunately, DNF is perhaps the last game we’ll ever see for some timeas Gearbox seems content to squander his fanbase in rereleasing his one-hit-wonder along with adding Duke Nukem as a playable character in Bulletstorm. Perhaps Duke Nukem is relegated to end in obscurity, which isn’t due to him being dated in the modern landscape but misunderstood by developers who seem him only as an icon meant to be mocked or paraded around as fanservice to entice the die-hard fans to enjoy one more adventure with the King himself.\nIf Shadow Warrior and DOOM’s reboots have proven as well as the old-school inspired games like Serious Sam and Painkiller, these icons of old can stay relevant to modern gamers with changes made that stay true enough to the original.

This game is nowhere near great, but it is worth playing, if you just want a semi-old school fps, with immature humor and cheesy one liners. There are many flaws with this game (for example the quiet ear drum piercing whine the night vision shades make when they're on). However, this game is passable and is nowhere near the disaster it was made out to be. The shooting is fine (plus the shotgun is immensely satisfying) and the puzzles are easy enough, and spread out to where they are not too much of a burden. Some sections go on just a little too long (i.e the dreaded driving and underwater sections), but once they are done, they are done for good (except for the 4 or 5 turret sequences). I will admit the boss fights are a bit of a chore, but the boss patterns are easy to figure out and  all bosses, except for the octaking, are easy enough to defeat in one or two tries. This is not a great game, but I think you should try it out, but ONLY ON SALE! I enjoyed the game, but I force myself to try allegedly bad media on the regular. My standards may suck, but again I emplore you to try this game. Wait for a sale and pick this one up. It's about 7 hours of alright gameplay and maybe one hour of cumulative schlock.

{"product_id": "57900", "page": 55, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-08-09", "text": "Duke Nukem Forever is a perfect example of an okay game that had the potential to be a great game. It is built around solid--albeit generic and boring--shooter gameplay, and relies heavily on it's protagonist, the embodiment of a cartoonish understanding of masculinity, and the raunchy and gratuitous world of babes and bad guys that exists solely to feed his monumental ego.\nStory:\nThe Duke character, who is established as a virtually invulnerable and unassailable badass. It nails the invulnerable badass character, and the story around it fits very well, but I can't help but feel that such a premise is impossible to turn into a good story. The fact that Duke is static in his greatness makes him a dull character, and therefore the story falls completely flat. I couldn't care less about stopping the aliens and getting all the \"babes\" back, disregarding the occasional messages my d**k would send me. I can't imagine playing this game as somebody who doeesn't enjoy boobs, cause they're just about the only motivation the game presents to keep shooting people, cause god knows it isn't very fun.\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay was very diverse, and very ambitious; it goes from fast paced shooting, to monster truck driving, to goofing around in a strip club, to simple physics puzzles, to boss fighting, and back to shooting all in a very short period of time. There's so many different things to do in this game, especially for a linear shooter game, but as with most games with so many different things to do, none of them are really developed enough to be very good. Every aspect of the gameplay falls short of impressive, and therefore so does the gameplay as a whole.\nFor example, Duke Nukem Forever introduces the potentially very innovative shrink mechanic, where the player can shrink enemies and be shrunk, which creates situations where the player finds his/her situation drastically changed on the basis of scale. There's a part where the player finds himself shrunken and encounters full sized alien enemies. For a moment, it was very reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus, and I felt very helpless against my giant foes. I found myself leaping on boxes and hiding behind appliances just to survive. However, I soon found that, as the story established, I am not supposed to be helpless; I'm supposed to be Duke Nukem, the unstoppable badass. It turns out that I was actually just supposed to shrink them and kill them the same way I always do.\nThis sort of thing happens with every new gameplay mechanic: sooner or later, I find out that it isn't really all that different from the core gameplay or simply isn't very well designed. For example, during the monster truck segments, I attempted to crush a car with my monster truck--as anyone would--and immediately affixed the small are between my tires with the hood of the car and was stuck. Later on, I discovered a forklift. Surprisingly, they actually gave me the ability to raise and lower the forks, despite the fact that the only purpose of the forklift is to slowly splatter enemies with it, regardless of how high the forks are.\nBecause the game has so many different parts, none of them are fully developed. The developers wanted to make a shooter game, but for some reason weren't content with the lack of sweet monster truck jumps and shiny t*ts, so they spent more time on stuffing the Duke Nukem Forever with extra sh*t than they did making the core gameplay unique or interesting. But, in the end, the extra sh*t proved to be a very much necessary break from the lackluster shooting gameplay. In fact, the game mixed things up enough for me to not care all that much about how uninteresting any individual part was.\nIn summation, it's not a bad game if you don't need a story. In fact, if shooter games are your favorite thing, play this game. You'll probably like it. Hell, I kinda liked it. I was just a little disappointed. The game fell short of it's ambition, but it's still very stable, in no way unplayable, and is pretty self aware. Probably.\nOverall Review = 5.3\nUnimpressive, but it's okay\n(P.S.

That was really ♥♥♥♥ed\" in a bad way.\n* Even for a 2011 title, the game shows looks ugly aesthetically and technically. There is one exception and that is the short intro level and the first section of the penthouse level which looks decent. Everywhere else, the textures and the post-processing effects (you can turn off) is extremely distracting. Might as well use the 96 Build Engine, which at least has its charm.\n* The brilliance of Duke Nukem 3D/64 was in its  level design which encouraged exploration. Levels such as Hotel Hell, Area 51, and Dark Side brilliantly used context and space. I could not say the same with Duke Nukem Forever. Levels are much like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥version of Half Life 2 where you have to navigate Duke to a goal while cinematics are happening in the background. This doesn't play into the strengths Duke Nukem titles had in the past.\n* I can defend having two weapons in games like Halo where it forces players to think through certain strategies. The more chaotic design of Duke Nukem Forever is incompatible with the two weapon system. Also the game doesn't really introduce any new fun weapons like in Duke Nukem 3D/64. You'll be sticking to the least interesting, but effective weapons.\n* Enemy and boss designs are very lackluster. The AI is very simple even for a 2011 3D game. The previous titles (including the TPS games) AI felt smarter than the AI in Duke Nukem Forever. The animation is very sloppy. After you kill an enemy, the enemy kind of floats awkwardly to the ground\nWhat I liked:\n* The game got a lot of flack over the driving sections. I honestly enjoyed the driving section despite the noticable glitches. I also liked the small puzzles like shrinking Duke and remote control cars.\n* The humor in the very start of the game. If they would have kept the humor of the first 2 or so hours of the game, Duke Nukem Forever would have been an order of magnitude better. But unfortunatley, it stops fairly quickly either becomming too ♥♥♥♥ed or just too serious.\n* Encouraging players to interact with the enviornment by boosting your health meter when you do things like shoot basketballs in the penthouse rec room is an awesome idea.

The sound effects in this version of compressed to an inexcusable degree. Everything sounds like it's underwater.\nThe newly recorded voice lines don't really carry the same feeling as the original lines, either. John St. John didn't give it his all in his performance and Duke sounds more bored than anything else. Gearbox were considerate enough to allow us to select the original voice lines, but like the sound effects and music they're compressed beyond belief.\nThe new graphics are kinda nice looking, but they're no better than eDuke32's \"Polymost\" graphics. In fact, they're basically identical.\nThis version of the game also uses the \"rewind\" system from Megaton edition, which I don't like at all. Basically, when you die, you're given the option to rewind the game to any previous point in your playthrough of the level. This removes a lot of the challenge from the game, removes all consequences for failure, and there's no way to turn it off.\nThe game has no option to disable VSync as far as I can tell, and the game has mouse acceleration enabled with no way to disable it. There is also no way to adjust the FOV. All of these features were present in the Megaton Edition.\nAlso, and this is the most damning thing, this version of the game includes none of the game's expansions, with the only reason given being a smarmy \"those aren't 20 years old yet :)\" from Randy Pitchford. Megaton edition included these expansions and their exclusion here is inexcusable. The only feasible reason that they were excluded was so that could be sold later as DLC.\nAll in all? Don't buy this version. It's inferior to the Megaton Edition and costs twice as much as Megaton Edition. Chances are, you probably already own Megaton edition since Devolver practically gave it away for free numerous times. If you don't own it, unfortunately there is no other option for you. Thanks to Gearbox's underhanded business practices, Megaton Edition has been removed from all official online retailers and the original versions of the game have been removed from GOG.

The Megaton Edition, which was removed because it provided 5x the content this does for less money, was superior in just about every way. It's hard to wrap my mind around how they actually made this edition WORSE when they already had the Megaton to work with.\nThe remastered Duke voice is higher fidelity, but the voice acting itself is clearly phoned in and un inspired.  They did no remastering with the original sounds and so the stark contrast with the voice is distracting and grating more than enjoyable. Ignoring the voice issue, I don't even know how, but the sound effects sound worse than in Megaton edition. It sounds like they ported from a Gameboy version. The strangest things have been removed. The intro menus look nicer than Megaton, but all in-game graphics and HUD are pixelated and ugly, they got rid of the reskin and pixel smoothing Megaton allowed you to turn on or off. You can't rename your save games, it's just \"Slot 1\". Why? Such a trivial change that would require you to actively change code to remove functionality.\nThey added colored lighting, a feature present in every Build source port for the last, what, 5 years? 10? No updated textures, no 3D models, none of the other functionality offered for free by EDuke and others. Only new weapon added is a variant of the freezethrower that's been lurking as dead code in Duke 3D since day 1, which was never implemented because it didn't add an enjoyable experience to the gameplay. Only one new enemy I've encountered so far, a trooper with a flamethrower. All the expansion packs have been stripped out, presumably so they can sell it to you again as DLC.\nI'm not done with the campaign yet, but I will say the new levels are very well done so far and the new music is good. The rewind feature is a nice addition to complement traditional save game system.\nOverall though this release could have been so, so much more, and it turned into a petty cash grab. Think about it... 20th anniversary edition. Think how much that means, how much content and functionality they could have given us. Think of what countless fans have been releasing for free, purely out of love for the game, for over a decade. Think of what Bethesda did breathing new life into the Doom remake. Think of how Gearbox could have seized this opportunity to make amends for the travesty of Duke Nukem Forever. Instead, we get this trash. I don't think Gearbox cares about or respects their customers, and I don't think they love the Duke IP.\nDon't buy this. Don't support this kind of corporate greed and consumer gouging. I don't condone piracy, but I sure as hell won't be surprised when the new campaign files find their way on the torrent sites just to sidestep this abomination.

So what does that make this? A cash grab.\nThe new episode features 7 main levels and a secret level created by the original level designers of DN3D, also the guy who did the original music is back! That's pretty amazing to be honest. Read About their thoughts for each of the levels, including the interesting tidbit that each level took approximately 2 months to make:\nThe new levels are really well done, and fairly tough too I think. They aren't as compact but are bigger and more spread out because they don't have to deal with hardware limitations like they did 20 years ago. The new incinerator gun is op; ammo is plentiful, it holds 99 shots, and the shots 1 hit kill the regular enemies and do massive damage to the others. It sucks against enemies that can't be set on fire though. The new firefly enemies are annoying (in a good way), but they tend to be glitchy because sometimes when you shoot them the shots don't register. It's nice seeing completely new areas and artwork. I also really like the new music too. Basically it's a worthy addition to Duke Nukem and deserves to be the official 5th episode. My only complaint is that we got just 1 new enemy.\nThe game has a true 3d render which you can toggle on and off (the original render was 2d sprites which stretched when you looked up and down). The rewind feature from the old DN3D release on consoles is finally on pc. When you die you can rewind all the way to the beginning of the game and any point in between and start over from whatever point you choose. Really cool! I'm a big fan of developer commentary and some of the things they have to say are interesting, I just wish there was a lot more. I'm not a big fan of the re-recorded Duke voice lines, fortunately you can toggle the legacy lines back on.\nIt's all straight from the horse's mouth, Randy Pitchford. Here are tweets where he mentions a definitive edition:\nHere is where he tells you the only reason to buy this game is if you want to play the 5th episode as soon as possible, like I did, and assuming you don't already own DN3D:\nThe difference is when a company like Bethesda is going to make a complete edition they don't remove expansions for sale, release a new expansion, then tell you if you want the old expansions along with the new expansion in one package with some more goodies then you'll have to wait and buy the complete edition later.\nHere he suggests waiting for a sale:\nYes everyone knows almost all games get a sale eventually, but as a developer it's bad business to\nyour potential customers to wait for one. Plus I already told him I bought it. Reading comprehension deficiency?\nHere he confirms there will be no dlc, free or paid:\nI guess it's good he won't try to nickel and dime us by making us pay for what should be there, but why can't the missing expansions be free dlc?\nIf only we knew what you know so we could understand these baffling business decisions.\nDuke Nukem is as great as ever. If it weren't for this being an incomplete edition due to a feeble reason then this would get all my thumb ups. If you don't care about the missing expansions or the reasoning why they aren't here and you want brand new Duke then by all means buy this game! I want more Duke so I bought this despite knowing everything here before release.", "hours": 4.6, "username": "solaris32", "products": 3368, "early_access": false},

You have to go to options to load it.\nIn the Menu's there is a new option that loads you into a website to make a account? A bit wierd and un-needed in my opinion.\nThe Christmas campign, Life's a Beach, and D.C map isn't on here from I can tell. <-- Big note.\nOver all these are minor picks but that's cause it's Duke.\nI am speaking in the understanding you've played a Duke game before and are just curious on how it goes.\nI give Duke a solid eight out of ten. It's not perfect but I enjoy it.\nI feel Atomic Edtion is better over all cause it has all the campaigns in it. This removes the extra packs to add in one? You do than loose some major fun packs.

In it's current state though I find it hard to recommend this particular version of Duke 3d.\nThere are certainly good things about this particular release. The new levels are well done, the new music is very fitting, and the new \"incinerator\" ended up being a more fun weapon than I thought. The carry over of the Xbox versions rewind system is certainly a plus. The new renderer, while not as pretty as eduke's polymer, is pretty well optimized so performance is better than polymer in most cases. While the new voice clips seem out of place, there is a legacy voice option. Dev commentary is a nice feature though it is sparse in some areas and overly abundant in others.\nThis release has numerous flaws however that I find both weird and unforgivable. First off someone at gearbox did an absolutely horrendous job converting all the sound files to .ogg and everything sounds very muffled because of it. There appears to be no way to turn off auto aim which becomes more of a hindrance when you have played duke 3d as much as I. Finally and perhaps the most frustrating to me is they added some weird mouse smoothing effect that makes mouselook perform wonky with no option to remove it.

I mean the gameplay i saw looked pretty meh in my opinion, and I told myself \"the only thing that would save this version is the 5th episode\". And fortunately, the 5th episode is really ♥♥♥♥ing good.\nEpisode 5 was made by level lord (the guy who did the original duke 3d levels) and they feature lots of secrets and an impressive amount of detail considering the engine being used. there is also a new enemy that has a flamethrower and can shrink itself to make it impossible to hit with bullets. there is a new weapon included in Episode 5, and It feels pretty underwhelming. it just throws a ball of lava out which lights enemies on fire and kills them a few seconds later, which i can do with the shotgun or rpg 3 times faster.. the game also has a lighting effect now, which looks almost exactly like the polymer render from Eduke.\nthe gameplay is pretty much the same, and thats good! the original duke 3d was ♥♥♥♥ing awesome to begin with. some of the sounds are really weird (pistol firing sound mostly) cause for me they sound like they are coming through a pillow. The XBLA rewind death feature is included in this game which is a nice touch for people who cannot quick save diligantly. Duke's voice was also redone, and it sounds pretty okay. you can change the voice to legacy if you want to through the menu.\nI feel 20$ may be a tad much (that may be because I have bought this game for the unteenth time), but the 5th episode is definately a redeeming factor.\nDuke 3D still stands as one of my all time favorites.\n8.5/10", "hours": 2.6, "user_id": "76561198014561335", "username": "3fitty7ven", "products": 332, "early_access": false},

I'm going to try my best to stay un-biased and civil for this review.\nNote II: this review is going to assume that you've played Duke 3D in some form prior to this.\nFirst things first: The rerecorded lines are terrible. St. John sounds bored, there's no umph or badassery, and the high quality sounds out of place amongst the low quality sound effects and alien noises. Thankfully, you can turn on \"Legacy Duke Talk\" which disables the rerecorded lines.\nSecond: The graphics. The new lightning is prettier than I expected, but holy hell it makes the game look dark. I had to turn the brightness way up to see in some of the low-lit areas (and I'm not talking about the pitch black areas like the area before the elevator in E1L2.) It looks alright in the end, though.\nThird: The available options are pretty limited and barebones, but they get the job done. You can change keybinds, mouse sensitivity, controller settings, whatever. You can turn the new lightning system (and the rerecorded Duke lines) on and off. That's about it. Not that I'm complaining, really.\nI have yet to touch the new episode and will update this review with my thoughts on that once I'm through it.\nAll in all, if Episode 5 is decent, this is still basically just a slightly watered down version of Megaton.

There is a button to keep the car steady while you're driving, but it really doesn't help much, I feel like I'm driving the jeep in Half-Life 2. I had a better time driving the warhog in Halo.\n-Graphics are a little outdated, but that's excusable because this game took 12 years to develop.\n-You can only carry two weapons at a time. May I ask why? In Duke Nukem 3D, you can carry all the weapons with you. Even in Serious Sam 3: BFE, Duke Nukem Forever's rival, you can carry more than two weapons. This game basically made Sam more badass than Duke.\n-This game is basically for people who are Glenn Quagmire from Family Guy, you're constantly having a bunch of sex jokes and nudity thrown at you. I mean yeah, Duke Nukem 3D had the same thing but it wasn't so constant. I mean I don't mind all of it but imagine if some dude who still lives with his parents is playing this and one of their parents come in and see this game.

The story is straight forward and very simple, there is little learning curve and the levels, though quite linear are interesting nonetheless.

It is very unbalanced in difficulty and plauged by cumbersome controls, the story and levels are acceptable but the combat leaves a lot to be desired. Some fights are too easy and just require cover and a few shots, you might find yourself wanting more puzzles and less fights, despite this being an action oriented game; while others are obnoxiously difficult for no reason.

Boy was I in for a treat. There are things in life that some say are impossible to comprehend or fully appreciate unless you try it for yourself. I am not unfamiliar with Duke Nukem, however, I was not raised in the time when it was most popular. A time when a man could go to a costume party and see three different people go as Duke despite the fact that none of them looked anything like him. A time when 3D Realms was a household name and not some random video game company.\nI never thought a game could be so bland and boring until I played this. Granted, it is pretty easy for me to get bored of different video games fairly quickly, I still am pretty shocked. The characters are so bland and have no personality to them (this is one of the first times I ever cared to notice this in any game so this is pretty major that this stuck out so much to me). Basically every character you come accross shows no emotion and barely opens their mouth when they speak to you. Also, everyone has the same body type as other people who share the same gender. This was just kind of weird to me. The setting is pretty dry and boring as well. The gameplay and story are garbage, just absolute trash. Shoot a bunch of enemies and then run into a new area and shoot some more. I am only scratching the tip of the iceberg here.\nIt feels like the creators had no idea what to make the player do so they decided to have you just go in a straight line and kill some enemies along the way. This is probably why open world games are so popular, because the player has more control over the story (the way they travel, what they do etc.) which makes the game more fun. Considering that I did not wait the 12 or so years it took some people to receive this game I'm not particularly angry about how bad this game is.

I would have perferred less talk and more ripping and tearing of alien flesh in a scifi extravaganza but this just isn't the case for this disaster.", "hours": 9.7, "user_id": "76561197993611845", "username": "Dick Richie", "products": 68, "early_access": false},

Decent, not as great as all that. Still will represent here what I wrote back then.)\nThe King is back; does he still reign? Spouting one-liners, kicking alien rear and wooing all the hot babes like he always has, I’d say he does.\nThe story picks up around fifteen years after Duke’s last adventure, just like in real life. Duke is living high off of the fame and worship of his adoring public; the world simply loves Duke Nukem, and why not? He singlehandedly saved Earth with an impressive arsenal of weapons, secured the safety of the beloved women of the planet, and undertook many grand feats all over the world! After all that, he lapsed into semi-retirement in Las Vegas; he bought a casino, surrounded himself by beautiful women as is his wont, and parlayed his fame and marketability into media enterprises, fast food chains and more!\nWhen the aliens come back under a pretence of truce, however, he is warned to keep out of their way by the President himself, saying he’s in talks with the Cycloid Emperor himself, whom Duke defeated in his last encounter. His General friend and handler grudgingly agrees, that maybe the aliens are here to make peace, but all that quickly becomes moot; his secret hideaway, the Duke Cave, as well as Vegas itself, is under attack! Just like before, the aliens made the first move, and now it’s up to Duke to make the last.\nGameplay is definitely a throwback to classic FPS’s, and seems like a tribute to the real fans of Duke from years past. It works really well, but has, unfortunately, also worked to turn off fans of “new-school” gameplay, who have blasted the game for lack of originality as well as its use of several modern gameplay mechanics mixed in with the old, including regenerating health, and limitation to two weapons carried at one time [This was patched soon after release; now we can hold four weapons].\nThat doesn’t, however, mean a thing to me. Things have to change, and I think Duke Nukem Forever brings just the right amount of change to keep things fresh, and the new turret and vehicle sequences, as well as fully interactive minigames including pool, pinball, video poker and others, mean you’ll be playing the game for a very long time.\nMultiplayer, again, samples from the new-school without being in it. The persistent leveling system and challenges of many other recent FPS’s make appearances here, with the reward system relating not merely to gameplay enhancements, but additions to Duke’s personal penthouse! That’s right, when you’re not bashing the aliens’ heads in during the campaign, or those of your buddies in multiplayer, you can walk around a multi-room museum of Duke’s accomplishments and conquests, which are unlocked as you level up in multiplayer. The replay value is definitely there!\nSo, as Duke says, COME GET SOME! Five out of five!", "hours": 12.9, "username": "EazyCheeze1978", "products": 1009, "early_access": false},

Seems like a console influence.\n-the humor is forced, but Dylan from The Doctor Who Cloned Me was pretty good.\n-would like to have shown this game to my nephew but due to the humor, language and nudity, I couldn't.\n-DLC - moonbase segment too short.\n-DLC - Trip to the moon too fast Could have made the trip to the moon a journey, fighting your way out through space to\nthe moon. We piloted land-based vehicles, why not space vehicles as well?\nPros\n-Modern graphics. Duke and his world illustrated in full 3D. Larger levels. More space to move around in and explore.\n-Tribute to the tropes that made DN3D as beloved as it was\n-fast movement. Most fights were fast paced\n-a return of many DN3D weapons, enemies and babes now in 3D rendering of course\n-Return of Duke's brand of humor (also in 3D) - even more adult this time around. Kind of a con as well as I would have liked to allow my pre-teen nephew to play this game\n-Return of his interactive world - interactive objects and activities you can do as much of as you choose - the pool table is back!\n-Some puzzle solving\nAll in all I feel Gearbox put in a good deal of effort to creating a worthy Duke Nukem 3D successor and I feel that for the most part they have succeeded. I also played The Doctor Who Cloned Me and enjoyed that one as well. This game was made for the DN3D fans of the 90's, and I recommend it for old and new fans. If Gearbox or 3DRealms released more Duke Nukem content I would expect to be able to enjoy that as well.\n****Spoiler Section**************\nI wish they/me/we didn't kill Doctor Proton.

He really wasn't evil through and through. He instilled love and camraderie amongst his clones. Ironically, clones of a person he wished to kill. There could have been a whole DLC exploring his battling his clones and granting a larger view of his world philosophy.\nThis is fiction so here's how to bring Dr. Proton back.\n- A scientist of Dr. Proton's genius was able to clone Duke, therefore he can clone anyone, including himself.

So let me explain my thumbs up.\nThis is my second time playing this game. I actually preordered this game back in the day for 360. I wanted to support Duke. To say the least I was disapointed. I ran through the game as fast as I could so I could sell it and try and make some cash back from it ASAP.\nSo I am enjoying my second playthrough more this time. I know what to expect and my I already know that overall its a disapointing Duke game. Mxed out on PC this game looks pretty good for a 2011 game. IF you can grab this game for 5 or maybe even ten bucks AND you are a huge Duke fan and love playing any half decent FPS game, then the game is a thumbs up.\nBut I do agree with a lot of reviews. The sex and humor are WAY too forced. I did chuckle a few times. But the original Duke 3D was made by some fun, young, and immature guys. It was just their sense of humor. THIS game felt like it was made from the ground up by a a bunch of older dudes who just forced every crass joke they thought was funny into this game. Its forced and it shows. My other major complaint is its departure from Duke 3D. I have bought Duke 3D countless times. For PC, every version, even Vita. Its still a great game because it just fun shooting baddies. 1/3 of this game is sitting in a turret or driving. Or something that isn't shooting baddies.\nI will say for a 2011 game there is tons of small details thrown in the universe, but again, much of it feels like wasted opportunity.\nAnother positive is the sound. The sound is pretty amazing in this game. The guns sound cool and there is a lot of the sound effects from Duke 3D. I just played MW2 right before that game... and while that is a better game for sure overall, the sound in COD games is horrible. All of them. No bass. The guns sound like they shoot frozen corn. Every gun sounds like a paintball gun. Duke Forever has awesome sounding guns and explsions.\nSo my thumbs up is this: for 5 bucks its a decent FPS romp with SOME laughs if you can overlooks the not funny jokes.", "hours": 14.0, "username": "GR34TD3STR0Y3R", "products": 449, "early_access": false},

{"product_id": "57900", "page": 67, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-06-15", "text": "Ah, Duke Nukem Forever. One of the most infamous titles in history for its prolonged development cycle and the rather savage beating it took in the press once it finally was released. In 2011, I just took everyone's word for it that the game was a total disaster and stayed away. That wasn't easy for me since I had been a huge fan of the series, even going as far back as the first two DOS platformer games. I know I'm late to the party on this one, but when you've been waiting since 1998? Waiting 6 more years to finally put hands on the unholy grail of vaporware doesn't seem all that long.\nOverall, I would have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. For a game that's almost universally reviled; I was expecting much worse. I'm not really sure what people were expecting from a game that can't help but have one foot in a previous decade. If this had come out even close to being on time, say 2001 to 2004 at the latest? I think its reception would've been significantly better. It possibly would’ve even been considered groundbreaking if it had beaten Doom 3, Unreal 2 and Half-Life 2 to market as intended. The graphics are perfectly serviceable and in keeping with the overall visual style of the previous games. Nearly all of the classic alien monsters are back with fresh designs that look great! Some might find having to repeatedly bash the space bar to break free from enemies when they're right in your face to be gimmicky, but I didn't mind. The gunplay is good, at least with the weapons it has in common with Duke 3D. Your mileage may vary with the new laser based firearms that dead enemies drop. My experience was also benefitted from playing this updated PC version that allows the player to carry 4 guns as opposed to the 2 of console versions.\nThat's not to say that it doesn't have its problems. What passes for humor is consistently childish, boorish and chauvinistic. All of the pop culture pastiches are oddly anachronistic; either referencing things not fitting the time of its early development or things outdated by the time it was finally released. The level known as The Hive does feature some uncomfortable moments where the player has to kill bound women who've been impregnated with aliens. However, none of these things were nearly as distracting or offensive as I had been led to believe. Duke 3D wasn't so different in terms of adult content and it's considered an all-time classic. I think it's more that the world has moved past such things and Duke hadn't kept up.\nDespite enjoying most of the finished product, I can't help but feel that the real tragedy of this entire saga is the older versions we missed out on. The E3 2001 trailer in particular was mind blowing to me at the time of its release. I couldn't wait to play THAT game! Most of the backgrounds from Duke’s casino in Las Vegas, to the Nevada desert and the Hoover Dam did make it into the game, but what about all those cool moments and characters? Would it have been that hard to include the pick-axe wielding miner character in the desert section, if just for a cameo? I mean for being a focal point of early screenshots, you think he would’ve made the cut.  Where was Duke’s female companion, Bombshell? Upon beating the game, I couldn't help but wonder... what about this took 10 more years to complete?! If they spent over a decade tweaking and refining the game, why is so much missing from what we were promised? It seems all the delays were mainly spent scrapping and entirely redoing the art assets; trying to be competitive visually with whatever game Valve, Epic MegaGames or ID Software had on the horizon. Although the downloadable content episode did eventually include Duke’s original nemesis, Dr. Proton, and the Terminator-esque robot characters, even that didn't find a way to fit in all the missing content we'd been shown from the 1998 and 2001 demos.\nI suppose we'll never know what could've been if the management at 3D Realms had been more disciplined in their approach. After 14 years of hype, it would’ve truly had to been the greatest game ever made to live up to everyone’s expectations. Although it often succeeds on its own merits, the unnecessary delays and multiple graphics engine switches negatively impacted the game. Perhaps that's why it was lambasted in 2011; other games had already long since done was this is trying to be and do. In particular, one can obviously tell the developers were greatly influenced by the original Half-Life's cinematic approach. Trading in Duke 3D's exploration based levels for fixed action set pieces didn't have to be a bad thing, but the execution left something to be desired. They were never going to win the race by standing in place and observing what the other runners were doing, telling themselves that they'll reach the finish line \"when it's done\".\nIn summation, if you've ever enjoyed a Duke Nukem game in the past; give this a try. I guarantee there will be a moment or two that makes you remember how much you loved those games. If you're easily offended by sexist jokes, cartoonish gore or dangerously hyperbolic levels of machismo? Stay far, far away. If you're looking to play a modern first person shooter with up to date graphics and game play? This probably won't be your thing either. However, if you're interested in the process of game development, I.E. why certain projects descend into so-called Development Hell? This is a fascinating object lesson. Truly an anomaly in the computer game industry as a product released out of its proper place in time, it's worth experiencing at least once. You might be surprised how much fun you'll find yourself having. Check your unrealistic expectations at the door, recalibrate your mindset to the early 2000’s and as Duke would say, “Come get some!”", "hours": 52.4, "user_id": "76561197977957168", "username": "Dehumanizer", "products": 37, "early_access": false},

I'm assuming it's on sale and your willing to throw away five bucks for a game that might give you some hours of decent entertainment, but I won't deny that DNF could provide some players with a satisfying experience.\nDuke Nukem Forever is an old-styled FPS with a modern makeover...\nwhat the devs would like to trick you into believing. Actually, Duke Nukem Forever is your standard shooter from the early 2010's with very little old-school about it. It reuses the narrative theming of the original shooter but borrows little from the original's gameplay, and that's a bad thing.\nTry to picture your generic FPS from the 2010's and you got the gist of Duke Nukem's gameplay. Linear levels, 2-4 weapon slots, regenerating health, cutscenes, action setpieces feautring QTEs, and a smaller array of enemies. The devs use a smaller array of enemies compared to DN3D and designed certain classes of enemies to have varying firearms, but it all just feels samey when over 75% of enemies you encounter are a reskin of the soldier-with-a-gun enemy archetype.\nOne of the game's biggest sins is limiting the amount of guns Duke can carry. The player is limited to 2-4 guns at any given time and trust me the devs had to scale back the complexity of enemy encounters to accommodate the fact that the player can only carry two weapons.\nAnd the weapons aren't particularly great either. Many of them are a variant on the rapid-fire assault rifle archetype and not all of them are adequately powerful. I stuck with Ripper because it felt good to use.\nKeeping on with the modern touches of DNF, Duke regenerates health over time (or 'ego' as the game calls it). I don't think regenerating health is an interesting gameplay mechanic and in most other games I'd consider it a big problem however in DNF I almost welcome because it makes sense that a big macho guy like Duke Nukem would literally walk off any kind of injury he takes.\nThe linear levels of DNF might be game's biggest flaws. They're linear, like you would assume. This is total contrast to the delightfully open-ended levels of the DN3D. Despite taking place in similar urban environments like the original, none of the environments feel like they're supposed to thanks to rampant linearity and a lack of mechanical character within the levels. Occasionally you'll get to play around with some level objects and increase your maximum health, but that's barely enough.\nAnd the places you'll venture through are varied but not inspired. You got casinos, desert highways, alien hives and even hydroelectric dams. If you got a taste for urban warfare, DNF at least has that going for it.\nThe game tries to mix up pacing by adding in vehicle portions or setpieces where Duke is shrunk to miniature size, but those twists don't do too much to make the game fun.\nMany of these actions sequences go on too long, especially the “mini-Duke drives a RC car” sequence in the beginning and the “Duke drives a monster truck across the desert highway” sequence toward the end. It's filler and in the cases of Duke getting shrunk down, that just seems odd in a super-masculine story like DNF. Duke getting shrunk happened in the original but it was for a short sequence and was a key to solving a puzzle.\nSpeaking of puzzles, Duke Nukem has them and although some are a little too gamey and uncharacteristic of DNF, many are acceptable. For all of its modernizations, DNF does not have an arrow on the player's interface telling them where to go next. The game allows the player to figure out how to get to the next room or progress and oftentimes it requires exploration or using a weapon in a creative way, which works with the game's style.\nIn this latest edition of the Duke Nukem saga, the story is more cinematic as expected in a modernization of a classic shooter. More swearing, more boobs, more violence. It's not drastically different from the original DN3D but DNF doesn't have the same vibe.\nI'm sure the developers put in all the sexiness and machismo in good fun but with how better and more “realistic” the presentation of DNF is compared to the originals, the character of DNF grows old quickly and becomes tiring and unlikeable. The original didn't shove its humour and spunk down your throat every minute so even if you don't like the sexualization of bodacious babes or the overly machismo attitude of Nukem, you weren't suffocated by any elements you found unpleasant.\nThere is an audience to Duke Nukem Forever. If you don't mind overly long levels, driving set pieces, boobs, juvenile humour, and outdated celebrity jokes you might dig Duke Nukem Forever. The best things I can say about it is some guns feel really good to shoot and sometimes the linear level design is inspired in how it directs the player.\nIf you don't fall within that bullseye of a recommendation, you're better off playing something else.", "hours": 19.4, "username": "DoubleCakes", "products": 428, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

The reviews slating long load times and dodgy frame rates must be referencing the console versions because, on PC, none of this is the case, the game was incredibly smooth on my meagre setup so you shouldn't have a problem getting it to run well on most systems.\nThe game is a flat out stupid affair in terms of plot, characters and references to other games. The plot is that aliens invade, take the Duke's girls and he follows in pursuit doing what he always does once he runs out of bubblegum. The references themselves are poorly implemented, hamfisted ones but then again what else can they be if inserted within a comedic game? I guess what appeals is how audacious the game's tone is and how I can't really fault it when it comes to pacing. It's a fast moving game that takes in a good variety of settings, adds simple puzzles and . One of the things I really liked was how messing with the environment gifted you with more health, meaning that not everything break from combat felt like pointless scene-setting up to the next gunfight.\nLike most modern shooters, health regenerates which sucks but isn't a complete deal breaker. At least the idea has run its course for the most part these days and developers are slowly re-establishing the much better idea of having health packs in their shooters. This makes combat relatively uninteresting for the most part; its made up for, however, by the weapon selection which is near identical to that of Duke Nukem 3D. They are all overpowered, fun to use, punchy and cathartic and really help make every combat encounter just one long relentless blast-fest like all the early 90s shooters were like.\nOverall, the game is basically functional and relatively exciting to play through, though it has plenty of half baked ideas, like the mostly useless alien weaponry found in abundance, a driving sequence which unfortunately becomes very monotonous to the detriment of the otherwise good pacing and some bland boss fights, characteristic of most 90s shooters. There is also some bad platforming sections but thankfully are over quickly before you get too annoyed by them.\nI'd say it was definitely worth playing for the tiny amount I payed for it (less than a quid). If you can't get it for as cheap as that, less than £5 is decent price to pay. It's certainly an adequate game, with enough strong elements to keep you invested, and isn't technically broken as reviews suggest (my guess is that is has been patched to hell and back).\nSolid 6/10 game.", "hours": 11.4, "username": "metaldude92", "products": 50, "early_access": false},

Actually no in my opinion, Here is why\nThe game was released in 2011, around 15 in troubled development. Forever is a direct sequel to Duke Nukem 3D. The game was first announced in 1997, reannounced in 2001, and again reannounced in 2007. The game then saw life breathed into it around 2009 as they (Gearbox Software) confirmed they were finishing the game. The game plays like a game from that era of FPS games. Limited weapons, sometimes overwhelming enemy numbers, but I personally find it enjoyable like that. If you do not like the limited weapon numbers, you can change it in the ingame options menu. The gameplay is just fine, it is nothing super special, but it functions on a basic level and can actually be pretty fun at times, when enemies try to surround you, and you have to use the right weapons in the right circumstance. The game also runs well in my testing of the game. Without V-Sync enabled (highly suggest you use that) the game can hit access of 1500 FPS, while with vsync, the game is locked at a very stable 60. The game also has many varied environments, but the colors used are kind of washed out, and overly dull in my opinion.\nAnother thing that has always bothered me about this game is the rebounding health bar. I get that when it was released, those were and still are the most common way of health regeneration in these types of games, but for a Duke Nukem game, that was a questionable decision. Although it really does not affect gameplay to much. The voice dialouge by Jon St. Jon (voice of Duke) is honestly really good. I think this is the best version of Duke, even if he does say some of the lines a bit to often, or if he repeats some of the older games lines, they are still enjoyable to hear. The game also loads so much faster than the console counter-parts in my playtime of the game.\nOverall, the enjoyment factor for you may vary when compared to me personally, and that is alright. The game is really not as bad as people make it out to be. The controls work, and are actually pretty good. The weapons are standard for FPS games, and the variety in environemts is actually a nice change of pace for this game. The voice acting for Duke himself is also a highlight. Negatives include repetitive gameplay, some cheap deaths, the extremely crude humor (not really a negative for me personally, but some people may not like it to much.) The pointless side activites, and the overall lack of replayability. I say if you can find this game dirt cheap, give it a shot. I personally enjoy the game, and maybe you will too if you actually give it a chance.", "hours": 8.3, "username": "MetroidFREAK21", "products": 59, "early_access": false},

Sure, it's not great and its a bad Duke game when compared to the likes of DN3D, it's prequel, but there's fun to be had here. I can see why it wasn't well received and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. I wouldn't pay full price for this on launch. Not to mention the changes they made to the gameplay after launch (more weapons slots) were pretty significant. Very significant.\nLet's get one thing out of the way first. The Visuals. They are nothing to write home about but won't make your eyes bleed either. There's a distinct lack of colour even when i bumped up the vibrance in my GPU settings. I can only imagine how dull this looks without the extra colour vibrance. On the PC, the textures are a huge step up from consoles. There are still some ugly ones but overall not really that bad to look at. This game gets a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥for its crappy textures and I can assure you most of them come from console players or reviewers. Not every texture is a sore to look at.\nI have nothing much to say about the audio besides the fact that its lacking a whole lot in everything. The music isn't engaging and the guns all sound pathetic. They lack punch in terms of effectiveness in game and the sounds they produce. One thing I really appreciated and liked is Duke's One liners and Banter. I chuckled quite a bit but then again maybe it's nostalgia. I don't care. I liked it.\nNow let's get to the meat of this review. What matters in a video game of this type. The gameplay. It's easily the worst aspect of the game and that's bad news for a video game. It's such a mess of mixed ideas. The initial 2 weapon limit was absolutely stupid. Who thought that would be a good idea. Granted they patched in 4 slots but 4 slots are not enough to do justice to Duke's badass arsernal. To add insult to injury, the weapons all lack punch. You're not sure if you're shooting actual bullets or nerf bullets. Even the Devastator feels weak. It takes away all the fun in the gun fights. The gunfights themselves are boring af. At first I thought there was a certain sense of strategy involved in the fights but then I realized all I did was hide behind ♥♥♥♥ing cover. This is especially true thanks to the EGO meter, which I don't mind as much, but It kinda seems like the whole gameplay was designed around accomodating the EGO meter. This isn't Call of Duty. Boss fights can be infuriating at times and I found myself often exploiting the game environments to defeat bosses.\nThe gameplay isn't restricted to gunplay. There are puzzles in store which although are quite easy to solve and often times tedious, was a good distraction from the god awful gunplay. I liked the inclusion of it. The pacing could have used more work though and the loading screens are far too many but hey at least on PC its quick to load. I bet it lost points for that on consoles. Speaking of consoles, this game oozes of console design choice. Heck, even the control schemes seems skewed towards using a controller over a keyboard and mouse. There's this dreaded mouse smoothing which can be minimized but it still feels like trash to use. What's worse is the god damn way weapons are switched with no clear slot for your weapons so you'll have to shuffle through till you find what you want even if you bind some hotkeys.\nThe game has some other interactive segments like Driving and Platforming. The Driving though linear was surprisingly well done. It wasn't as open world as say HL2 but controlled WAY better than HL2. Then there are those dreaded platforming segments. I believe they didn't work too well back in the day and it still doesn't in this game. I hated them, especially when you get shrunk and have to do platforming. Creative ideas in there but fighting while shrunk is a whole other pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Still, I like how it tries to be old school with its interactivity and design in certain areas.\nAll in all, a lot of the♥♥♥♥♥♥this game gets can be equated to the platform it was played on, some console focused design choices, lackluster gameplay at times, the state on launch and the price paid on launch.\nI got this as a part of one of the humble bundle deals and keeping that in mind, this was a steal. I had fun playing this and if it gets cheap enough for you to want to spend money and play it keeping in mind the points I mentioned in this review, then go for it.\nLike I said: It's not a bad game.

What we have here is a game that completely disregards the concept of pacing and instead makes you slog through dull chores and sit through unfunny comedy sketches more than it makes you shoot aliens to death.\nDuke Nukem is supposed to be an action game, and yet it takes a good 40 minutes before you get a gun, and even then you're not really in any kind of significant battles. In a game like Half-Life 2, where you actually care about the worldbuilding and are trying to convey a certain theme or message, this would be compelling, but Duke Nukem's world is inherently shallow, it exists solely as a delivery mechanism for crude jokes. Duke Nukem is a simple character by design, so forcing us to learn about him and his world for almost an hour is a terrible way to start a game. For comparison, Duke Nukem 3D has you blowing something up in the first seconds of the game. The game continues in much the same fashion, you're usually navigating an empty environment or trying to solve some kind of puzzle. In one section, you get shrunk down and have to drive an RC car, which sounds really creative on paper, but you aren't actually doing anything in this scenario. You literally just drive the car down a very long hallway and don't fight anything or try to navigate anything other than \"go forward\". When you finally do get into a gunfight, it's usually with only two or three enemies at a time and then it's back to the slog.\nMost of the actual individual puzzles would be fine, and even very clever in many cases, if they were breaks in the action instead of the main action itself, but you're really left with a game that feels like it's constantly leading to something, only to never get there. This game didn't need to be groundbreaking, it didn't need to have the best graphics, or the best animation, or the best story, it just needed to give you lots of things to shoot at and fun ways to kill enemies, but it fails at the most basic action of a first person shooter, which is that it needs to have lots of shooting. Overall, if you want a fun, over-the-top first person shooter, try Bulletstorm, Serious Sam 3, Shadow Warrior, Doom, or even the original Duke Nukem 3D.

Sounds are fine, despite the casual asmatic chicken sound here and there.\n\n2 – GAMEPLAY\nIf you played Duke Nukem 3D you will be at home. This game is not a classic, at least a good one, is more a mess of a game. Some additions to the game, like driving, are bad, so most of the time the game is all over the place, and nowhere around at the same time.\nThere's no replay value whatsoever. If you are man enough to finish this game once most likely you will uninstall it and forget that you have it.\nJumping is not very intuitive, sometimes Duke jumps a lot, in other occasions he's unable to jump over a coin.\nPuzzles are laughable. Well except if you hate them. They are as hard breathing.\nKey cards where used once... in the tutorial.\n\n3 – CONCLUSION\nThis is clearly a Duke Nukem's game. Can't go around that. Is very similar in every aspect of original ones. Ok you can grab and throw a turd... and you have wall boobs... but just try to forget about that. The game is fun for a while, but then you realize that you are not 16 anymore and you like proper games. You have grown. You have wife and kids, newer generations does not relate with Duke anymore. Does the game olds up without Duke? No. Without him is a uninspired lazy piece of a game. And with him? Well, it still is an uninspired lazy piece of a game, but it has Duke... and it's a cheap game if in sale or in a bundle. 've sunk some hours in it. I had fun.

That being said, this game took 15 years to make! That gives a developer plenty of time to look at their product and say, \"Hmmmm... Is this a good game, and if not, how can we make it so?\" Allow me to point out The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly things on this game.\nThe Good: The humor is fairly nice and well-timed for the most part, and reminded me very much of Robot Chicken, Famliy Guy, and it even has hints of classic TV shows like GI Joe and Popeye. This was almost enough to carry me through it.\n, being the key word here. I also enjoyed the enemies; a combination of wordplay and mindless minions which made me grin a little every time I remembered their names.\nNow for The Bad: The combat is trying to be a mix of Call of Duty & Halo, and while it is acceptable most of the time, it can get repetitive and boring. New weapons and gadgets try to freshen things up, but they can get a little boring as well after making a Pigcop explode for the tenth time. In addition to gear, Duke can increase his overall Ego (or rechargeable shield; pick your poison) by doing \"manly\" and \"badass\" things like lifting weights, shooting three-pointers, making popcorn, using the bathroom, looking in the mirror... Just a lot of ways to do it; maybe too much.\nLet's get The Ugly: F**k Duke. F**k him and his sh*t-eating grin wearing, dark sunglassed, cigar-smoking, beer-chugging face. He's tolerable at first, but over time, I grew to despise him. He's only good in small doses, personally. It doesn't help that he insults various games like Halo and Gears of War, and (spoiler):\nThen there's the bosses: uninspired, boring, cookie-cutter bullsh*t. The physics also don't help things; the aforementioned Ego system uses the game's physics a healthy percent of the time, and these Ego challenges can range from stupid to nearly impossible.\nIn short, Duke Nukem Forever is an excellent example of how even big-named icons can take a big tumble when handled poorly. Oh, and fun fact: a month after the game release, it was estimated that less than half a million copies were sold but there was enough sold to make a profit.

One of the few first person shooters I had bought virtually day one in hopes of the gaming industry redeeming itself and bringing back the golden age of first person shooters. Unfortunately like many before me, I was dead, dead wrong. The real question to ask is what DNF does right rather than wrong. But I can barely scrap together any real coherent positives about the game. Instead I am just going to give a minimal rundown of some problems I had in the extremely long list of excruciating issues involved with DNF:\nThe guns are limited to two. TWO WEAPONS AT A TIME. IN A CLASSIC GOLDEN AGE FPS SEQUEL.\nRegenerating health. Why on God's green earth was this considered an okay notion in a Duke Nukem game. The basis in use for regenerating health is to hide behind something or take cover until your health gradually recovers. When you put this into context for Duke Nukem, it make almost 0 sense.\nThe ego system. Although the idea seems fitting in retrospect to Duke's Alpha male personality, once translated into gameplay it becomes nothing more than a gimmick that breaks up the action makes the game feel like a poor man's POSTAL 2 somehow.\nGearbox lying through their teeth. Gearbox have made their fair share of half decent games in the past, but in these recent years with games being released under their alias such as Aliens: Colonial Marines, Battleborn and Duke Nukem Forever, I have grown to despise them. The lies from both DNF and the Alien game about the promises being made, its visuals from E3 \"demos\" and rumours/facts that the company outsourced most of the work to newbie developers really makes me question the work ethic over at Gearbox.\nThe problems stack up against it more and more and I could rattle on about it for far too long, but I never even bothered to finish the damn thing. It is visually revolting, runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ weakest gunplay I have seen in a game, and literal \"♥♥♥♥ you\" to anyone who ever gave a damn about bringing Duke back. I don't care about how long the game was in development hell, and I don't care that Gearbox just think they can't bring old classics back into action.

I had an overall fun time playing it, It is well optomized, has very short loading times, and can even be challenging at times while not getting annoying. However, it is not a fantastic game by any means, the story feels rushed and jumbled together even though development of the game started way back in 1996. It is very easy to see that Duke Nukem: Forever went through very serious changes and the story and gameplay changed numerous times through its entire development cycle.  It is also very easy to understand that fans anticipating the games release in 1996 and having to wait until 2011 (15 YEARS TO MAKE) to play a messy subpar game to the previous titles, would cause massive outrage and hate that would inflict a mass of negative reviews across all platforms.\nLike stated earlier I had quite a lot of fun playing Duke Nukem: Forever and would certainly purchase a sequel if one was ever made.

So disappointing because the level design and non linear exploration is what made Duke 3d great. This is a linear shooter, with so many elements ripped off from Half Life 2. Mechanics are somewhat clunky but not bad. This is clearly not an old school shooter by any means.\nIf this game was called Half Life 3, it would've probably been received better because it rips off so many HL elements, but it's nothing like Duke 3d, and nothing like an old school shooter.\nIs it still a decent game? Well could've been back then, if you didn't mind linear shooters, but right now, even if the graphics are pretty good, it does not hold up well at all. Skip this game.

A simpler route would be taping your screen with a thin strand of plastic tape, the only downside to that is that you will not be able to scroll down your games list.\nHope we have informed you enough.\nYours truely,\nDr.XxxX\nSo This whole ordeal has infact been going on since 2011 so there's a very high probabillity that the real culprit to my decease was actually  Duke Forever, and not my ex wife.\nI deinstalled the game and i could not find the option to hide the game in my library so the first thing i had to do was grab a roll of black duc-tape cut out a thin strand and tape down my steam library with black duc-tape.

But if you want a good FPS, this is not a game for you.", "hours": 10.3, "user_id": "76561198013136696", "username": "Mungojerrie", "products": 280, "early_access": false},

It is boring, clumsy and very annoying.\nIt feels like I got robbed in a back-alley and somebody just took all my money.\nMore detailed description but careful *some small spoilers*:\nI have played the original Duke Nukem 3D back in the '90s on DOS, then the Duke Nukem Megaton Edition that got released on steam in 2011 (I think), played Duke Nukem Zero Hour on the N64 and the two games on the PSX (Time to Kill, Land of Babes) and I must say that Duke Nukem Forever is the worst Duke Nukem game and one of the worst FPS I have ever played.\nThe Duke Nukem Universe\n----------------------------\nWhen it comes to the levels you visit kind of the same places you also visited in Duke Nukem 3D. Duke Burger, Hive, a Space Station and the game is kind of lacking a mindblowing scenario that lets you make \"wow\" that is kind of nice.\nEverything looks boring and somehow uninspiring. You are following a total linear path through the levels and are\nnot able to vary the way you finish them.\nRemember the annoying remote driving parts in the original \"Shadow Warrior\"? Where there was a key on a car or a boot\nand you had to remote controll it, so you get the key. Well, yeah. They put this in.\nDuke has no health.\nHe has an ego meter that you can upgrade by playing pinball or looking at magazines or working out.\nWhen you get hit twice the meter starts to blink and as long as you don't get hit again, it recharges like a shield.\nSo no health packs. No health items.\nI've played on the highest difficulty level and even with this the game is way too easy.\nThere are a lot of squences where you have to use a gattling gun and shoot ships. You can't just walk away from that thing.\nNo. You got to use this weapon so the story goes on.\nAnd.... even more.\nDriving sequences. Yes, driving in a car and killing enemies. Jumping above cliffs.\nSequences, where you get shrunk and you got to jump through the level to procede. Wow, just a 3D Jump and Run.\nThe enemies are boring as well. There are not so many enemies types and definitely no new ones. They not even included the acid alien from the fourth episode of the original Duke Nukem.\nThe whole game \"feels\" like a hybrid between Halo and Mass Effect with a little bit of Duke in it.\nWeapons\n-----------\nYou can only damage boss enemies with the rocket launcher or the devastator. Not with the other normal weapons.\nIn the default setting Duke can ONLY CARRY TWO WEAPONS!!!!!\nSo if you don't know when there is gonna be a boss fight you will always have a rocket launcher with you.\nIn the option menu you can change the amount of weapons to four at a time.\nBut still: Why not let him carry all the weapons like in the original Duke Nukem 3D.\nThere are no new weapons in the game. They just took all the original ones. In the DLC \"Doctor who cloned me\" you get\na weapon like a small acid grenade launcher, but that's it. No new stuff really.\nWhen you shoot at enemies you also get the feeling that they don't care. The weapons don't have a specific strength on certain enemies. You will find yourself using the shotgun a lot.\nItems\n-------\nSteroids just make you punch like the \"Doom-Guy\". But you can not shoot at that time. Awesome, while all\nthe other enemies have projectile weapons.\nIn the option menu there is a shortcut for the Jetpack. But YOU CAN'T FIND THE JETPACK in the SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN!!\nSo why even implement it? There is also no scuba gear.\nDisturbing moment (*spolier*)\n--------------------------------\nThere is one very disturbing moment in the game. Your girlfriends get kidknapped and you find them in the Hive, while they are literally being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the alien hive itself. Then they burst open and little alien creatures appear.\nSo. First you played through levels that were derpy shmerpy, happy here, shot there and a joke.\nAnd from one moment to another... this stuff.\nThis is completely inappropriate. I mean even in the alien games (AVP, Alien Colonial Marines) aliens burst out of hosts, but not like that. The developers really went the wrong path here.\nMultiplayer\n------------\nApparently there is a multiplayer, but nobody seems to play this, so you will find yourself in an empty level.\nDLC - Doctor who cloned me (*Spoilers*)\n-------------------------------------------\nThe beginning is kind of nice but then the story will very quickly start to disappoint again.\nThe last fight is on the moon against the Alien Queen.\nIt is one of the most annoying boss battles ever. You are really gonna be happy when you finish this boss.\nSummary\n-----------\nWell, DON'T BUY THIS GAME! Let's hope that there is never again gonna be a new Duke Nukem game.\nThis concept worked in the '90s, but not today anymore.", "hours": 12.8, "user_id": "76561198026012616", "username": "Torn", "products": 106, "early_access": false},

It really doesn't need that much to be a masterpiece, just open development tools and in the span of 3 years it would have lived up to the hype on fan love alone.\nBut that is the real issue. This was in a way a dead end for the hero I, and perhaps others, waited 12 years to make a return (I bought Duke 3D when it came out). If only it had been given a chance, we would have Borderlands as well as Duke franchises to follow.\nSo in sum, I love it, I really like Duke Forever.

And just maybe ... catch the interest of a broader fanbase and lead to a sequel, and hence more Duke awesomeness :D\nFor now take this as it is, something that's incomplete, partially broken, but with glimpses of genius.

I just bought this game in December of 2016 and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.\nThe graphics are like an early PS3/Xbox 360 game. By today's standards, it's pathetic. Ugly textures and the like, none of which are particularly important to me.\nThe animations are sickening and downright laughable, they are unnatural and when characters speak to you, they are hardly ever focused on you. The voice acting is weak and the sound effects are just as bad. Just generic repeated sounds for almost everything you can think of, including the water, cars, explosion and some of the critters you'll see about.\nThe game has one major thing going for it, and that is gameplay. The action sections of the game are insanely entertaining. The shooting feels natural and visceral. It's quick and fluid, there are plenty of reasons I enjoyed the action parts of the game, which basically makle the entire game, because... well... the rest of the game is awful. Pathetically designed platforming sections that make you want to tear your hair out, driving sections that control like an early driving sim. I had more toruble in the driving and platforming parts of the game than most of the action bits. But don't take that as the game being easy, because it couldn't be farther from the truth. This game is relentless in it's enemies difficulty. The enemies will not stop until you are dead, naturally. The excellent gunplay helps keep you on your toes and getting the last satisfying hit on your enemies before they turn you into a Duke Burger.\nBesides the drawn out driving sections, the annoying puzzles and overall visual and audio downfalls of the game, it is still genuine fun and I am really glad I went through with it. I bought it during the sale and can say that it was at least $5 worth of fun. There are plenty of little hidden secrets in the game and even a virtual pinball machine.\nIf you are looking for a fun shooter, you can't go wrong with Duke Nukem Forever if the price is right.", "hours": 13.0, "username": "jogroar", "products": 48, "early_access": false},

One of the videos were the original E3 trailers of Duke Nukem Forever that was released around 2003, which were awesome trailers then and still looked like it would have been fun as heck even today.  Those bonus videos just made me wish that that was the game us Duke Nukem fans had gotten instead of the game I has just beaten.\nThere were a couple of neat/amusing moments in the game such as a couple levels where Duke has been shrunk and has to work his way around a kitchen without touching the floor, or having to drive RC cars through a casino, etc.  The shrunken Duke levels got boring pretty quick as the novelty wore off yet Duke keeps getting shrunk.  The 3D updated aliens of Duke Nukem 3D looked pretty cool.\nOverall the game wasn't that good though.   Most of the levels were boring, or tedious.  The colors felt washed out and bland for the most part.  I found myself wishing I was playing the Duke Nukem Forever game that we were introduced to in the 2003 - 2005 E3 game trailers.  The color tones used in this release made me not care about how a single level looked.\nSeveral of the levels are tedious or poorly designed.  The most annoying thing was the number of times I died in the game because of technical problems in the game.  There are clipping issues everywhere in the levels..  Say you get jumped by a group of monsters so you start moving around strafing and weaving through cover to avoid damage while trying to do some killing.  Out of the blue, you get snagged onto some object in the level.  You know you hit an object so you try to slide around it, or jump it or something, but no....Duke doesn't move.  You are forced to move the exact oppsite direction you were moving when you hit the object to get off of it. (e.g. You strafe left into an crate, you can't move forward, or backward then continue strafing, you have to strafe back to the right.)   By the time you figure it out you are usually cornered and...dead.  The aliens don't  have large hit boxes, but they have huge collision boxes.  If one gets right up on you, it's hard has heck to get around it because you can't strafe around, or jump.  You have to move directly away, yet you can't easily get enough distance to strafe around before the alien almost kills you, and many times does.\nThe water levels suck.  Not once did I die to an enemy under water, but I died 20+ times because of all the clipping issues in the levels.  A doorway (because you didn't go precisely through the middle of tghe doorway, or piece of seaweed, or something stopped me cold and I couldn't get around it fast enough.  Duke is so sluggish swimming in water that you can't afford to get stopped since you are trying to get to air pockets to breath.  Duke kept drowning.\nSadly Duke Nukem Forever was barely worth the $2 or $3 dollars I paid for it on Steam.", "hours": 49.3, "user_id": "76561197967876062", "username": "TopperHarley", "products": 210, "early_access": false},

It's not strictly terrible, by any means, but it's also not good enough to be memorable, which I find to be hardly acceptable for a modern day sequel to one of the most iconic games of PC gaming. It was supposed to be one of the best games on the market, but instead, it turned out to be yet another bland not-terrible shooter. True, it's fun, I guess, but I expected more, even after reading the devastating reviews.\nAlso, the fun itself is present only for the most part. When it's not present, it's because the game gave me some of the most frustrating level segments I have ever seen. First one is that one platforming segment involving spinning cogs, where the player needs to aim his jump at certain holes. Because of how everything is spinning, the last part can be frustrating. (By the way, what the hell is platforming doing in a Duke Nukem game? Was it present in Duke Nukem 3D too? I wouldn't complaing if this was a 2D platformer, like Duke Nukem 1 and 2, but DNF is not that, it's an FPS.)\nAnother ones are both underwater segments. Dear. Mother. Of God. I was THIS close to just ragequitting the game because of how I-want-to-pull-out-my-own-kidneys-out-of-my-body-in-frustration-and-throw-them-at-computer-screen-at-full-force they felt. Whoever thought those segments were a good idea deserves to be ♥♥♥♥ing shot. Now I know EXACTLY how all those people feel when they complain about underwater levels.\nAmusingly, after 5 and a half years that at this point have passed since DNF's original release, there are still some people playing this game in multiplayer. True, it's only two or three servers, but still. I expected that the multiplayer would have died a long time ago.\nAlso also, the game can be beaten in some 10 to 11 hours, when played on Medium.\nSo, after I collected my thoughts and feelings and wrote what I did, what do I have to say at the end? Is Steam's simple recommend/not recommend system good enough? Actually yes, it is.\nSadly, I cannot recommend DNF. If this was a game set in an original IP, I probably would have recommended it, but a sort-of-generic shooter that's trying too hard to be modern does not deserve to wear the Duke Nukem label, because that label is, in video game market, too damn important to waste it on games like this one.\nSimply put: for what it's called, it's a too big disappointment.", "hours": 12.8, "username": "Anothga", "products": 898, "early_access": false},

A man of few words, unless you've read his book.  When this game came out players and critics alike were hellbent on telling people how horrible this game was.  But is it really?\nI can honestly say that after playing it for well over a year now that the game is quite good.  It's certainly not the best by any means, but is enjoyable.  The game has the same dirty humor from the past installment along with new jokes and pop culture references and topless girls.  All of the guns from Duke Nukem 3D are back along with a few new toys, the aliens are back with all the familiar faces and new ones, and best of all John St. John returns to reprise his role as Duke.  There's a great deal of interactive objects including a couple of minigames.  The multiplayer is entertaining and keeps players on their toes in eight man Duke Match complete with lots of laser trip mines and rockets.  The story is even goofy and generic like a \"B\" action movie.\nThe game however is not without its cons and flaws.  Parts of the environments and DM arenas feel somewhat rushed.  Some places still have bugs that from time to time get exploited by other players.  On rare occasion you can fire at a target and have an explosive blow up in your face after hitting an invisible segment of wall.  The controls are fairly descent (though you'd have to ask someone else how it handles with a keyboard and mouse) albeit a bit stiff.  The AI, while relentless, can at times seem too predictable.  Lastly, the stages seem a bit too cookie cutter and getting through them is basic wash, rinse, repeat.  You'll take down a few waves of enemies and solve a puzzle then move on.\nNow while these things do bring the game down somewhat, it doesn't ruin its playability.  The game itself was a rushjob (after taking 12 years to complete) and while some things are inexcusable other things are forgivable.  Thankfully there have been a few updates including the addition of carrying four guns instead of two.  Also the DLC is very entertaining.  If you're an old Duke Nukem fan or a shooter fan I recommend trying this game out.

After sampling a video game based on his past heroics (the game Duke plays is a revamped version of the final level of the third episode of Duke Nukem 3D), he arrives on the set of a talk show for an interview. On his way to the show, Duke witnesses a news broadcast announcing that aliens have once again invaded. Unlike previous encounters, the aliens initially appear peaceful and at first seem to pose no harm to the humans of Earth.\nDuke's talk show appearance is cancelled to allow television stations to cover the alien invasion, and Duke retires to the \"Duke Cave\", his personal home. There, he receives a call from the President and General Graves of the Earth Defense Force (EDF). The President orders Duke not to harm the invaders, and adds that he is in diplomatic talks with the alien overlord. Duke obliges this request, but he and Graves remain uneasy about the whole situation from start. Before he can leave his chambers, he is attacked by hostile aliens who are swearing revenge on Duke.\nDuke is forced to disobey the president's orders and fight his way through the alien hordes in an effort to save Earth. Whilst fighting through his casino, Duke witnesses the aliens abducting women, including his two live-in pop star girlfriends. Graves tells Duke that the women are being held in the Duke Dome, and that the aliens have a vendetta to settle with Duke. He also warns Duke that the aliens are using the Hoover Dam to power a wormhole so more aliens can come through. Duke travels to the Duke Dome, using a wrecking ball to damage the building to gain access. Inside, he finds swarms of Octabrains and the missing women, who have been impregnated with alien spawn; Duke's girlfriends die after giving \"birth\" to alien babies. Duke finds the Alien Queen in control of the Duke Dome and kills her, but is wounded in the process and blacks out.\nAfter regaining consciousness, Duke fights Pigcops and aliens in through the Duke Burger. Soon, he travels to the Hoover Dam in his monster truck; after battling through the dam, he finds his old friend Dylan, mortally wounded. He tells Duke that the reborn Cycloid Emperor is at the dam, and that the only way to shut down the portal is to completely destroy the dam. Before dying, he gives Duke his demolition charges and wishes him luck. Duke places the explosives and destroys the dam, but the currents nearly drown him.\nDuke is revived by an EDF soldier, and awakens to find the portal gone. The President, who was also at the dam, rages at Duke for ruining his plans to work with the Cycloid Emperor, revealing that the President was actually intending to have the aliens kill Duke and he would cooperate with Cycloid Emperor so he could control the Earth, and that he has ordered a nuclear strike at the site of the dam to wipe out the remaining aliens, intending to leave Duke there to die as revenge for foiling his plans. The Cycloid Emperor emerges and kills the President and his security detail, revealing that he intended to kill the President after the deal. Duke kills the Cycloid Emperor and is rescued by Graves just as the nuclear bomb explodes.\nThe game ends with a satellite surveying the detonation area and listing Duke Nukem as killed in action, to which Duke replies off-screen, \"What kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ending is that? I ain't dead. I'm coming back for more!\" In a post-credits scene, a short video depicts a press conference, where Duke announces his intent to run for the 69th President of the United States.\nin other words its a ok game", "hours": 8.2, "username": "JurmanyeomanVN", "products": 165, "early_access": false},

The guns were all enjoyable to use and the enemies provided a good challenge. And the most important part to a Duke Nukem game, the Duke himself is still charismatic and enjoyable to listen to. Both him and the game are overtop in all the best ways.

F.I.F.T.E.E.N. years!!! To make.\nAnd they probably had a lot of money put into it.\nIt's repetitive, it's boring and it's not that good In my opinion.\nAfter that many years, you would except some kind of big open world/sandbox game or at least something that has a good replay value but no... Not this time, it doesn't have that much content either.\nWhat this game does great you wonder? Well, the graphics are pretty well made and the environments are well made, you can see from afar and that kind of stuff, but that's it, graphics doesn't matters in a game, don't and come say that it does, it does NOT, gameplay and content does.\nIn all honesty, I prefer the graphics in Doom than the graphics you find in this game and nowadays FPS.\nIt's just too bright and unrealistic.\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion's characters are horrible, yes, I agree, but that's another story, those are textures and meshes, not graphics, If you take... Civilization II for example, It's simple and beautiful.\nBut anyway, the graphics doesn't matters too much, as long as it is not fulfilled of Instagram's filters... That's just ugly.\nSo In the end, the graphics are not good at all in this game, the textures are good but nothing special, I'd like to have fun playing the game, not looking at the view in the game, If I can do both then that's good but it's content and gameplay or nothing.\nSo in the end, if you want my opinion, I'd say to pass this game, if you want to be sure, try it by yourself but I'd suggest you to play other games, there are so many good underrated games out there just waiting to be played.\n4.5/10 At least, it's still better than the recent Call of Duty titles except maybe the first and second game, and that is not normal, even if the two first games in the series are good, we're talking about Duke Nukem... But I'd prefer to look away from it like it never existed.\nBy the way, the game itself isn't good, even if it would have another name such as \"The Alien Hunt Arcade\", it's just not good so no, it has nothing to do with nostalgia and the thing of \"the oldest are always better than the remakes/new ones.", "hours": 0.9, "username": "Valhalla Folkwolf of the North", "products": 2558, "early_access": false},

What more could you ask?\nYou might ask: why am I recommending this game when everyone else has panned it? Because it's a great satire that went over everybody's heads. Duke was always a parody of '80s action heroes, and here he is, still being a parody of '80s action heroes except now everybody thinks '80s action heroes are dumb now, so they don't see the irony. This game is The Expendables before The Expendables was awesome.\nAlso, the action is solidly fun through the entire game. The shooting feels good, and it has all of the elements of more popular shooters (such as Doom (2016)'s executions) before they became cool. This game came out before everyone started raving about \"throwback\" level design, so it got lambasted for being, basically, a more polished version of Half Life 2 with a coat of comedic paint thrown on.\nThe comedy is low-brow, I'll grant you. Again, we see that Duke came out just a few years too far ahead of his time. I mean, he's less debauched than the new Deadpool movie, and that did pretty well by critical standards.\nSometimes someone needs to break ground so other people can be successful, and they take their lumps for it. Duke Nukem Forever is one of those games. It did a lot of things that everyone is all too pleased to rave about in popular entertainment today, but it did them before they were considered cool.\nNot that this game is for hipsters.

Which is ok I guess, how many shooters even have more than one or two jokes in it, but it's not nearly as fun as how it could have been.\nAnd that's one of the biggest problems, you constantly imagine how much better it could have been. I really miss a lot of things in modern shooters and here is a game that actually tries to bring them back, but it's doing all of them in a just ok kind of way. So if you're like me this game reminds you of lots of cool things you may have forgotten about only to realize that they were done much better in the past.\nSadly it's just because of the lack of variety in first person shooters that I really enjoyed it anyway. I want to see more like this: shooters that don't take themselves serious at all, silly weapons that aren't really useful but are there for fun, a main character that has a personality, enemies that aren't just other humans... When that's such a rare thing I guess you just can't be picky, it's better than nothing and I'm glad it still got made at all.", "hours": 18.5, "username": "Dafon", "products": 208, "early_access": false},

Actually the game reminded me quite a bit of the Half Life series: 1) first person shooter 2) aliens come through portal to invade Earth 3) lots of non-shooting portions with puzzles 4) platforming 5) driving sequences 6) some similar levels like the factory\nSOUNDTRACK\nOne advantage it has over Half Life is that it actually has a soundtrack (and a pretty good one) during gameplay. The trend of games without music needs to stop - other big names are also guilty of this such as the Bioshock series. Also the music is in MP3 format in a folder in the game directory if you'd like to copy it onto your computer before uninstalling the game. Most games hide the music and make you use 3rd party tools can be hard to find and/or difficult to use, so this was a nice bonus.\nGRAPHICS\nThey're decent but even on my very powerful i7 4790 with GTX 750 TI, there were framerate and performance issues for 10 to 15 seconds when  starting or restarting a level, and then the problems resolved automatically. On this system I was hoping to play at 3840 x 2160 resolution but performance was too poor.\nGAMEPLAY\nBoss fights were the best part of the game - challenging but fair and well designed. For the non-shooting segments, which are fairly plentiful, sometimes I wished the game would just move on (mostly during the first half of the game). But I solved everything myself without any help. If you want an all action game all the time game, you should look into the Serious Sam series. But even the original Duke 3D was not all action. Also, the underwater levels were not my favorites.

The game is not even close to perfect, just realise that\nI don't want a game to completely hold my hand, but I've had to look up a couple walkthroughs during this game, because some of the puzzles are so obscure and not remotely obvious, as I say, I do not want hand holding but I don't want to be thrown into something where I have NO idea what I'm doing. Having to work puzzles out every few minutes or so isn't really what I expected in a Duke Nukem game.\nHoly♥♥♥♥♥♥this is bad, platforming in an FPS... DOES NOT WORK, it's just completely boring and I don't see why they'd put so much of it in the game, platforming is not remotely entertaining in a first person shooter\nGame feels dated:[/b] The 12 years in production kinda show, because it doesn't feel like a 2011 game, it feels like some remaster of a early 2000s game, the game is hilariously clunky (which doesn't help the platforming) the graphics are borderline horrendous, considering this came out the same year as BF3 and Crysis 2... Even playing it 5 years later, it feels like a game that's 15 years old, and that's not acceptable. And I will reiterate that I am playing this MAXED in 1440p, my PC is perfectly capable of running anything I throw at it and it'll look good\nI love offensive humour, but it can get really too far and immature. Two naked girls being sexually assaulted by aliens and Duke going \"Looks like you got... f***kd\" It's just bad lol. I don't see why anyone would find cheap sexual assault jokes amusing, if you're gonna make these jokes, make them witty and clever, offensive for offensive's sake is cheap. The humour is generally pretty good but it just goes down a slope sometimes, as proven in this segment. It can just feel like they're trying too hard and like it's been done by a 12 year old who's heard some pub jokes, and it definitely does feel like that in a lot of parts. I had a scene where I have to look for a sex toy and a condom for a stripper, like wow,, hilarious...get it? Because sex toys are funny ha ha ha. So then I had to sit through an awkward lapdance, which I'd like to say has extremely poor graphical fidelity and is just a little bit..... cringey?\nLike... what?\nYou'd think on an i7 4790k and a GTX 980, I'd be able to run a game that is comparable to the PS2 era, but apparently my constant 200fps can just drop off a ♥♥♥♥ing cliff whenever it wants to, there are a lot of drops and stutters, maxed out at 1440p anyway\nOverall, unless you can get this extremely cheap (like a dollar) I don't recommend this at all, the humour is childish at times, the game is shockingly bad when it comes to feeling dated and it's extremely glitchy. But I literally paid like £1.50 for this game, so it's worth it for me", "hours": 5.2, "username": "Brexit Dog", "products": 627, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false},

After being in development for nearly two decades the game was released to a less than stellar recetption. Did it deserve that? Not really.\nIf you're a die hard fan of the Duke Nukem franchise there's a chance you may be disapointed here. The game had a hype it needed to live up to that it just couldn't. But what if you're like me and fired this up before you ever played \"Duke Nukem 3D\". In that case there's a lot to like about this game. It's a fun shooter with sometimes rauchy humor but it plays well. Jon St. John is on point as Duke Nukem and the game has a lot of enjoyable weapons.\nAfter spending some time playing \"Duke Nukem 3D\" I can see exactly why fans were disapointed, but I also see where the game was paying tribute to its predacessor and I think it did that quite well.\nI'd say this is a game worth picking up, though catch it on deep discount. I snagged it as part of the $1 tier of a 2K Humble Bundle and I was fine with that price. I'm very excited to pick up the games DLC \"The Doctor Who Cloned Me\" but not until it goes on sale for several dollars again.\nThe game's multiplayer is dead so it's safe to skip if you're looking for a game with longevity and replayablity through an online component, but if you're looking for a fun 80's-movie-esque single player campaign with a fun world (and a willingness to poke fun at itself) then I'd say pull the trigger and grab it on sale.\nI did play the game using the expanded inventory mode, though I may go back and redo the game with the title's limitation to two weapons and see how that plays.", "hours": 23.0, "username": "HWLights92", "products": 169, "early_access": false},

It's release in 2011 was met with a lot of hatred: and rightly so. It's poor production values are obvious. Anything that isn't directly in front of the player (including things that are in the distance) are a horrific blur. For a title released in 2011 it was unforgiveably ugly. Not to mention feeling incredibly dated with Arcadey-shooter game mechanics that were the norm more than 10+ years ago, in 2011 Duke Nukem Forever felt, well.. Very out of place.\nWith driving sections that were poorly designed and terrible puzzles (because when people think Duke Nukem, they think PUZZLES)\nTo understand part of the hatred, you need to go back. I mean way back - to the 90's. Duke Nukem was at the height of it's popularity. For fourteen years after the last Duke Game, many fans awaited this installment. Duke Nukem Forever has been in development hell for ages. People pre-ordered the game in the early 2000s', then had those pre-orders cancelled.\nShady business practices aside, what is Duke Nukem? It's very much a game that shines light on Duke Nukem as it was in the 90's: a game full of cheesy jokes, pop culture references, and crass humour. To Say Duke Nukem Forever isn't exactly what the fans deserved is, well, unjust. Duke Nukem forever IS an Arcade shooter in every sense of the word. It hits all those notes, and, if I admit, in 2016 it doesn't feel as terrible as it did in 2011 when you get past all the drama of it's long-awaited release. It's an O.K game. Would I have ever recommended someone buy it for 69.99CAD? No. There are definitely better games out there. But Duke Nukem Forever is fun for what it is.\nBut that's just it: it's fun for what it is, and what it costs NOW. There are better games out there that I think people could be playing. Is it absolutely horrible? No. Even for it's current price I couldn't recommend it for anything but a blast to the past - to see why what worked 20 years ago simply won't work today. And I feel like that's what Duke Nukem was trying to be. It was trying to be the same game it was from the 90s', and for a lot of people this brand of humour just isn't the thing that makes us laugh anymore. It tries to capitalize on nostalgia, and I always feel like without innovation or real passion behind a project, that capitalization is bound to fail.\nUnless you've got a few dollars and LITERALLY nothing better to do?

The only recourse is to watch them explode into baby spiders or to explode them by shooting them before they blow up.\nAs an independant exercise in circle-strafing, DNF can be fun and early on the unapologetic sexism results in some funny moments but the game wears quickly.\nDNF is longer than expected or wanted, and after fighting the same three stage boss 10 times, I quit Duke 4 chapters from the end, but not before Duke quit me.", "hours": 14.8, "username": "Darvin11", "products": 206, "early_access": false},

So, do I still think it's the worst game ever? Well...no. I've certainly played games that were much worse. But I still think it's pretty bad.\nDuke Nukem Forever is guilty of using just about every gimmick and cliche used in FPS games made in the 2000-2009 era, and I wish I was joking. Magically regenerating health, limited stamina, only being able to carry two weapons, forcing you to solve puzzles to progress, events where you either have to take control of a turret or drive a vehicle...you name it. But out of all these tired and overdone cliches, what really seals the coffin on this game for me is that this game is made up entirely of quicktime and scripted events, and the levels are so linear there's no room for any exploring whatsoever.\nIn other words, instead of the fast-paced and intense gameplay in a large map that required us to explore high and low for secrets, health,  ammo and keys to progress, while at the same time trying not to die to entire armies of aliens? That's all been replaced with linear paths, scripted events and NPCs that refuse to let you progress until you've either killed a few aliens the game wanted you to kill, or force you to listen to meaningless dialogue that adds little or nothing to the game, but thought you should listen to it anyway.\nSo did Duke Nukem Forever do anything correctly? Kind of. Duke is still that womanizing horndog that we got to know and love in 1996 that spews one liners and cracks jokes. However, unlike Duke 3d where it was done with some moderation, this game feels like it was filled to the brim with almost nothing but toilet humor and nudity galore. Not necessarily a bad thing, but my goodness does it tend to get old quickly.\nI didn't exactly expect Duke Nukem Forever to be a masterpiece after waiting for more than a decade for it to come out, but I did expect it to be something refreshing and new. Unfortunately it was neither of these things, and while I don't think it's the worst game ever, I've played far too many games that were just like it. 1.5/5.0", "hours": 31.9, "username": "Charlie McRapekit", "products": 418, "early_access": false},

It's good because Duke is a legend in the gaming world, therefore anything involving him gains automatically a lot of value. And it's bad because seeing how the game Duke Nukem Forever, after taking forever to be completed and relased, didn't turn out as glorious as Duke the man deserved, it's somewhat unfair.\nThat said, Duke Nukem Forever is not a bad game; it's a generally nice game and on certain occasions it's very good. It has well-made environments - sometimes particularly atmospheric, like the Ghost Town in the main game or the Tunnels in the DLC; the music is fine and fitting; there are several known enemies making a comeback (the Octabrains are back with a vengeance), and of course Duke is his usual badass self, with his hilarious lines and his ever-mighty boot.\nWhat doesn't seem to work that well is the general gameplay design; it feels rushed and incomplete. Some of the puzzles look complicated, but in fact they are so easy, you may end up solving them without realizing it. The vehicle mechanics are frustrating at times, and some of the boss fights drag on too long. And you may find that, apart from wanting to get certain Achievements, there is probably no big replay value. I guess that all that went wrong with this game is due to the fact the development team didn't remain stable from start to finish and at the end they had to complete the game somehow and release it with no further delay (just like it happened with Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness).\nStill, I did enjoy the game to some degree, which is why I am recommending it; also for sentimental reasons, because Duke Nukem 3D was one of the very first games that I played years ago.", "hours": 115.9, "username": "hisbrokenbutterfly", "products": 59, "early_access": false},

I would rather not play single player campaign again. Not that it's not fun because it is fun but because those not funny elements are dominating over funny ones - large levels where you need to run from point to point and shoot about three enemies in the meantime or some puzzles that you need to solve in order to proceed forward.\nIn conclusion, this is a shooter game with a moderate amount of shooting. Well, I call it a Duke Nukem Adventure Game rather than a shooter game. Those shooting scenes can get pretty intense, but after that there is a prolonged scene where you need to walk here and there and not much is going on.\nI give this game thumbs up, for the fond memories of it. If you've never played it then go on, it's not that bad. Definitely try the DLC The Doctor Who Cloned Me. It's short and it's fun.

I did play Duke Nukem 3D a long time ago and completed about one episode of it and few levels of other episodes. I do love classic FPS games such as the original Doom, Heretic, Hexen,Star Wars Dark Forces and Blood.\nThe only good thing I found about Duke Nukem Forever is some of the complexity in level designs, especially the parts when Duke becomes tiny and everything around you is huge.\nThe rest of the game is either average or bad.\nGraphics and animations feels very rushed like the game did not take its time (apperantly 12 years aren't enough). You can easily spot bad textures and you can notice how some 3d objects in the map have poor details. Animations for monsters are about as average and Duke's animations are horrible. Never in my life saw poor execution of QTE (Which is totally unnecessary in an FPS Game!).\nStory is very uninspired and has no plot. This detail can be overlooked but just like a bad porno, the game can't stop shoving flat uninteresting character to your face. The dialoug is very corny and horribly acted. Even Duke's voice acting makes me feel like the voice actor is uninterested or \"disconnected\" from the game. I wouldn't be surprised if he voiced his lines over the phone.\nGameplay as mentioned above, can get interesting with how complex you travel inside the level. Some shining moments were such as trying to get an item from a locked room by controling a remote car. However, the levels feels very unlively especially in the later part of the game. For example, interactivity with items is surprisingly limited beyond the first chapter (the casino and the strip club). Most of the environment is not affected by physics and most NPCs don't even feature lines to talk to you.\nThe game's asset is also extremely repetitive. It feels like every place in Duke's world owns barrels and wooden boxes. This is very surprising considering that 3D realm made games like Max Payne which had far much assets. Monsters types are extremely limited. Weapons are few and some of them are unnecessary such as Shrink Ray and the Freezing Ray.\nFinally, the most annoying and straight up bad design decision in this game is: Horde battles. You will find yourself mostly entering vast area, only to be locked in to face a horde of enemeies and a mini boss. It is very uninspiring and unfitting for this game.\nIn the end, this has been a very disappointing experience. I did knew the game scored bad but I kept myself open-minded as much as possible but after the horrible distastful ending, I couldn't. The level design concept could have been in a lot better game with another studio such as Valve or id softwares.

Aaron checks out Duke Nukem Forever...\nAlright, I admit it. Back in the day, I was a bit of a Duke Nukem fanboy. Duke 3D was amazing, and it was, in my option, the best FPS of the time, beating even id's Quake. So, it goes without saying that, when the next Duke Nukem title was announced after Duke 3D's release, I was very excited, indeed.\nAs the months and eventually years rolled on, this excitement started to wane. Setback after setback, no-show after no-show ate away at my enthusiasm, until I was left, much like every other fan, with nothing but a bitter taste in my mouth. Duke soon became vapourware and we'd all but given up on his return.\nAfter the fiasco of 3D Realms' closure, the final nail was, seemingly, hammered into the coffin. Did I care? No, not really. By that time I couldn't care less if Forever ever arrived. Sad, but true.\nWhen Gearbox Software announced it had resurrected the title and that it would finally see the light of day, I hardly jumped for joy. In fact, it was more 'meh' than 'yeah!' Still, if only for nostalgia's sake, I had to play it, but I was hardly pumped.\nSo, why then, despite the fourteen year wait and the heavily unoptimistic outlook of the title did I start to grin like a five-year-old when I finally fired up the game?\nYep, even with nothing but cynicism in my noodle, as soon as the familiar drum hits and guitar riffs of the Duke theme rocked out of the speakers, I was instantly ready to kick♥♥♥♥♥and chew bubblegum (and yes, I was all out). I was a very happy chappy, and memories of 1996's frag fest soon drifted back.\nSadly, though, this feeling didn't last all that long.\nAs we all know, Duke Nukem Forever has been in the kind of development hell that no other title has ever faced. Over the years, the project has seen several game engines, redesigns, staff changes and more. It's amazing that anything coherent came out of the development process, even after being hammered together by the talented guys over at Gearbox, and it's not long after starting the game that you begin the see the results of this tortured evolution.\nYou immediately notice that, visually, Duke Forever is a bit of a mess. To say that this looks like an original Xbox title may be a bit of an overstatement, but it's not a statement that's all that far wrong.\nThere's no antialiasing to speak of, leading to jaggies everywhere, texture pop-in is rife, and although many textures look great, there's a shocking amount of amazingly ugly, low res decals strewn about the world. Object modelling is often basic and notably rushed, and the overall feeling is very unpolished and disappointing.\nDuke Nukem Forever can, at times, look fairly decent, and although not a patch on today's cutting edge graphics engines, it still packs in the character and feel of the 90s titles. It's just a shame that it looks so dated technically.\nStill, graphics aren't everything, and you can overlook a lot, if the game underneath is a winner. Unfortunately, this isn't quite the case.\n\nThe core FPS gameplay in Duke Nukem Forever is as straightforward as it gets, and there's nothing in the way of complex game mechanics or originality to be found here. It's full-on run, gun and kick, and nothing more, really. Duke can interact with the environment, solve a few rudimentary puzzles and even drive a couple of vehicles, but for the most part, the game is basic shooter fare.\nEnemies are as dumb as their Duke 3D counterparts, and many of the advancements we've come to expect in today's FPS releases are missing, right down to polish, silky smooth controls and buttery aiming. Duke is often clunky and sluggish, which is a bit of a problem when many foes zip around the screen at high speeds.\nThe vehicle sections are decent enough, but controls are iffy, often leading to untimely deaths or bouts of wall-kissing as you get hung up on scenery, and load times are excessive, leading to prolonged pauses if you die and have to reload over and over, something you'll be doing a lot on higher difficulties.\nEven with these flaws and lack of TLC, Duke Nukem Forever's gameplay is solid enough, and a couple of enhancements have been made. Duke no longer has a health bar, but instead packs an Ego meter. This functions like everybody's favourite Spartan's shield, and as you take damage, it's depleted. Once it's gone, take too many hits and you're dead. Stay out of harm's way and it'll recharge. Simple, if wholly unoriginal stuff, but welcome nonetheless.\nAs you explore you can increase the size of Duke's ego by performing certain actions, such as lifting weights, winning at slot machines, signing autographs and even smashing a blatant Christian Bale-alike in the face. You can even play a fully functional pinball table to earn more ego.\nThis time Duke can engage foes in hand-to-hand combat, and can perform executions on wounded enemies. There's also a few QTE-style button mashing events to open doors, finish off bosses and the like. The inventory system has been mapped to the D-pad, making it easier to access items, and you can use a nifty ‘Duke-vision' system to see in the dark. These may be very basic changes, granted, but every little helps.\nThe problem is that, despite these few simple additions, Forever's a game that's never quite made it out of the late 90s, and it's painfully obvious that this game was conceived over a decade ago. Simply put, it shows its age.\nShake it, baby!\nLuckily, even though it was released many years ago, the original Duke 3D had some unique ideas that have stood the test of time, and have returned here. Most notably Duke's arsenal of weapons still packs an enjoyable punch (even if the weapon models are some of the ugliest I've ever seen), and the shrink ray and freeze guns are as entertaining as ever, as are pipe bombs and trip mines.\nThese lead to some cool moments, and the varied alien horde make for some interesting foes, if often stupid ones. Titanic Battlelords, floating commanders and deadly Octobrains are just a few of Duke's memorable cast, and each has been beefed up for this outing.\nThe many interactive environments and items add to the enjoyment, too, even if most are nothing more than frivolous detractions, and environments throughout are interesting, taking in such locations as opulent casinos, the burning ruins of Las Vegas and alien-infested hives.\nThere's also the simple, basic fact that Duke Nukem Forever is just plain fun, in a stupid, over the top way. In a time when we find ourselves wall to wall with ever more unimaginative and downright dull real world military shooters, Duke Forever is a breath of fresh air, and that alone will make the game worth it for some, even if it's nowhere near as good as it should be, and is more guilty pleasure than classic blockbuster.\nThen there's the 'humour'. Duke's trademark misogynistic ways and crude style are back in force, and may or may not hit the mark, depending on your appreciation of schoolboy humour and poorly modelled cleavage. It's all a little childish, really, but this is a Duke Nukem game, so it's to be expected.\nThere are a few pokes at pop culture in there too, such as the aforementioned Mr Bale, and even a dig at Halo's Master Chief. It all adds to the fun, but is hardly a substitute for polished gameplay.", "hours": 0.1, "username": "King Renly Baratheon", "products": 443, "early_access": false},

It's bland, it has toilet humor kids in 5th grade would find too low to their tastes and it's pretty god damn boring. I am assuming you were thinking to yourself \"Well then maybe I should buy this as a joke game?\". To that I say: Maybe.\nThis game came out after what I liked to think was a new era in the video game industry: Mass Effect, Crysis, Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, The Orange Box and others were bringing new ideas to the table - new mechanics were introduced, gameplay aspects renewed for a new generation of both console and PC gamers, new narratives, stories and much more dedication was present in each and every game. I was expecting every game released from 2007 and onwards to be groundbreaking, or I was at least expecting them to follow the same lines.\nUnfortunately, I was young and naive.\nThis game is slow, it features a small variety of weapons and allows you to carry only two of them (EDIT: You can actually mark the option to allow you to carry 2 additional guns... Why?! what's the point?!), it is anticlimactic, sexist and distateful (see: \"wall♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and \"pregnant women explosions\"), has the level design of a Call of duty game, without the mildly fun parts, and to top it all off, it's unfunny.\nIf Duke Nukem Forever was a rollercoaster, it would probably have a very slow setting, homeless people posing as monster and strippers waving as you pass by them, and much like a rollercoaster tycoon ride, it will end with either you dying or asking for a refund.\nMy final score for this game is \"You should be paid to play this game\" (Which I wasn't, unfortunately).", "hours": 7.7, "username": "Wormri", "products": 390, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Cool 90s simulator\nFrom the♥♥♥♥♥slapping humor, the referances, to the usage of Beer and Steroids as items. Especially the action figure levels\n2. First person shooting with cool guns\nAfter playing Shadow Warrior, Doom 1 & 2, Heretic & Hexen and some Duke 3D: I think I understand what \"cool guns\" is. Or how its suppose to play.\n3. Filler content\nPuzzle platforming, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ short \"interactive\" cinematics, physic puzzles, lots of \"oh we can do this in engine like its 2001-2004!\"\nThese 3 things mesh somewhat. But its also problematic.\nI.E The irst 2 things don't really mesh, the way this game is made.\nYou are controlling a very slow elite solider, who can barely move. The gun's generally don't do anything either. Most of them are terrible in their own ways. And as the level design evolve, you spot another issue: Duke is practically blind. The extreme narrow vision don't work out at all.\nWhile its true a lot of 90s fps features very narrow vision, it worked out differently when you could snap across extremely large rooms, in rapid speed. It works out terrible when Duke is slow, can barely damage anything, can't see anything, and keeps getting flanked.\nBut that also brings us to the next point on the agenda: Enemies don't really deal damage. They don't feel scary. Fighting them feels like swatting flies, slow flies that poke you.\nBut generally your guns are not any better. The best weapon might even be the pistol, simply because its accurate and has raw damage. Every other weapon has crippling flaws, and generally feels awful.\n\"Different weapons do better against different enemies\", thats what the hint tells you. Not really. The pistol is the best. Even if something like the shotgun is cool, its pointless when it only works as a melee weapon. And all weapons feel worse than the pistol and shotgun.\nBut then:\nPoint 3 of the list comes if, you complete a combat section. Either you have to wait for new cinematic and a enemy bash trough something, or you encounter the dreaded physic puzzles.\nYou can't just become good, and go really really fast. Instead you have to spend a lot of time waiting around, for the horrible cinematics. Some of them are amusing, but most aren't that good. Its just waiting around A LOT for a NPC to stop blocking door ways.\nAnd at some point, you enter a boss fight. Okay, so you need to use explosive weapons. But explosive weapons have practically no ammo. Often there will be a ammo container on the scene. Or a rocket launcher tucked somewhere on scene, so you can obtain a explosive weapon.\nIt doesn't feel great at all.\nSome of the finishers looks good, as in humoristically good. Thats a plus. But most bosses are terrible to fight. The best boss might even be the final one, because it lacks the obstacles earlier bosses have.\nBecause instead of camping a ammo chest, rocket pigs are his reinforcement.\nBecause instead of a gatling gun, he tries to be impressive.\nThe core problem with this game, is that it fails to understand what a power trip is, fails to understand speed, and simply isn't juvenile enough to do any of the things it wants to do.", "hours": 9.2, "user_id": "76561197997524265", "username": "del_delly", "products": 65, "early_access": false},

What Gearbox then did was patch all that unfinished content together, and create a fairly minimal amount of content in order to obtain a game that they could release.\nAs far as the gameplay goes, the game is unfortunately way too much of a departure from the original, with a 2-weapon loadout made to facilitate the use of a controller (later patched to a 4-weapon loadout in single player), fairly slow movement speed with the possibility to sprint in very short bursts, and some fairly clunky platforming at times. The gunplay itself is decent, but suffers from annoying reverse mouse acceleration which can't be disabled.\nDue to the troubled development of the game, the levels are quite a mixed bag. Some of them are cleverly designed (The Duke burger is a favorite of mine), while others feel quite linear and empty, and the graphical quality varies a lot between areas. Exploration is rewarded with easter eggs and collectibles, and the levels are filled with interactive elements.\nThe story is actually based on the original one written in 1997, and is a straight sequel to Duke Nukem 3D. Just like in D3D, it is extremely simplistic. The writing can get really cringe-worthy at times, with some dated references and (intentionally?) bad jokes. The voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag too, despite John St John reprising his role as Duke Nukem.\nThe multiplayer is pretty much dead by now, with very few servers to be found.It is comprised of 4 very basic game modes and 10 maps in the main game. The \"Hail to the Icons\" introduces 3 more modes as well as 4 maps, and \"The Doctor Who Cloned Me\" also contains 4 maps. There is a progression system in play, with objectives that unlock hats, glasses and shirts upon completion, and a levelling system that unlocks items in a virtual apartment of sorts.\nIn terms of graphics, the game is very inconsistent It does have a couple of fairly impressive set pieces, but many levels turn out to be very ugly, plenty of low-resolution textures and a somewhat uninspired design. You can really tell the artwork that was created in 2003-2006 from what was made at Gearbox during the last stages of development.The lighting model is very good, though, with a Doom 3-style fully dynamic lighting system that looks genuinely good in some places.\nThe biggest problem with the graphics actually comes in the form of a poorly implemented, low-resolution, depth-of-field effect. Not only does it kick in at all the wrong times, but it is also so low-resolution that it just drowns the screen into a pixelated blurry mess. And unfortunately, the only way to turn it off is deactivating all the post-process effects altogether (There is a fix for that however in the form of an older build of the FlawlessWidescreen utility).\nThe music and sound design are pretty good, with a decent heavy metal score and fairly convincing sound effects.\nIn terms of performance, the game runs fine on a variety of hardware. Loading times are fairly long, and the game suffers from the typical old Unreal texture streaming issues. There is a fair range of graphical customization available, however the options aren't very detailed, with some options bundled in a single menu entry. There are also only post-process antialiasing methods available, which only add to the already blurry nature of the game.\nThe single-player campaign can be completed in about 10+ hours, with some hidden collectibles to find. The multiplayer is mostly dead nowadays. The \"The Doctor Who Cloned Me\"' DLC is very good, and adds an additional 4 hours or so of additional single player content.\nIn conclusion, while it was a bitter disappointment in 2011, Duke Nukem Forever isn't as terrible a game as most would say. I did have quite a bit of fun playing it, despite its many flaws. However, it wasn't worth its full price at the time, and it still isn't worth its current price either. It's one of those \"get it when it's on sale if you are really curious\" kind of games, and the price does drop quite significantly when it goes on sale.

For any amount less than $10, I would say go for it if you are curious.\nThe game is full of slapstick and crude humor. It was a bit more over the top that I had expected, but pretty much fit a 'Duke' game. The graphics looked sort of ok in some parts, but at other times, it looked like it came out in the early 2000's than 2011. Story was stupid, but then again, it is pretty much what I expected. There were quite a few puzzles for a FPS, and in some places they were fun (saving the girl in the burger restaurant), and others felt tedious. In some areas, just trying to navigate and find the proper path was more than a little frustrating. The gimmick of getting shrunk was fun, especially when driving the RC car. There seemed to be no more than 10 different enemies, and after a while it got a little boring. Duke's voice-overs were limited and also got annoying fast. You could increase your max health by interacting with certain things in the game; this was probably my favorite part of the game. I think I had more fun playing the slots, air hokey, 9-ball, and slapping the wall b--bs around more than the rest of the game.\nI was not expecting much at all from this game, so for that, I marginally enjoyed it. After beating the game, some things get unlocked such as unlimited ammo, big heads, and some other fun looking stuff. However, that is not enough to keep me interested.

The unique and interesting maps made Duke3D what is was - fun.\nDNF dispenses with this and puts in a rat-run of boring linear corridors sprinkled with tired \"jokes\".   You just run along a corridor from scripted set-piece to scripted set-piece, listening for the oh-so-funny-and-never-heard-before wisecracks (that was sarcasm, by the way) waiting for the inevitable and unavoidable chokepoint where you are trapped until you've killed the amount of monsters the map maker wanted you to kill then a door opens you are allowed move on.\nThis wouldn't be so bad if the weapons were any good, but they're not - you're limited to two-at-once (you have to drop an existing weapon to pick up the RPG for instance), and are unsatisfying to fight with feeling underpowered and you feel restricted by ammo.\nTo be fair there is the odd glimmer of something greater - a few puzzles and parts of the maps hint at what could have been (e.g. the wrecking ball puzzle and other areas around the \"Duke Dome\"), but they are still ultimately trapped in the boring corridors.\nIt is a real shame, but I've not given up on Duke.

Puzzles, platforming and minigames, later more puzzles, platforming and minigames... All game long... It's almost funny how Duke jokes all the time about bad puzzles but makes you do those anyway. Puzzles are also so embarrassing that you only find them funny and clever if this is the first game you ever play. Level design gets slightly better after \"The Hive\" chapter, so the first 2-4 hours of this game are easily the worst.\nAction parts won't save this game as they are also frustrating due underpowered guns and weak monster design. There are mainly 3 kind of enemies you encounter on the first half of the game: Assault troopers that teleports away after damage and also takes like 20 bullets to die. Octabrains that re-directs your rockets and rockets back to you what will one shot you to death. Pigcops who stands still and shoot or charges right at you. You rarely encounter more than 5 enemies at once so there won't be no Serious Sam - kind of slaugherfest to be found.\nAnother huge design problem comes with the weapons. You can only carry 2 guns at once with very limited amount of ammunition. For example the maximum amount of rockets you can carry is 5. Guess designers though that as there aren't much action in this game you won't need that many guns and ammunition. Game ain't amusing neither. Duke's outdated humor and oneliners are funny for 2 minutes but this game is pretty much built upon that crappy humor.\nThere just ain't anything especially well made in this game that I could mention here. Sounds, story, graphics, AI, voice acting, minigames, puzzles, boss battles... everything is medicore at best. There are nice amount of vehicles you can operate but controls are mostly abysmal. Only if you really keen on boobs and poop jokes this is what you are looking for. Although playing such a bad game makes you value more all the good fps games there are on the market.\nEven if this exact game (with late 90's graphics) would have been published in 1997 as orginally intended , I doubt it would have been a hit. There are just so many fundamental design problems that this game simply ain't funny to play.\nThis game is  a glorious opportunity for game developers to study how you should not make a first person shooter.\n10 - Perfect game\n9 - Excelent game, best of the genre\n8 - Good game, worth your time\n7 - Average game, nothing really special\n5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time\n4 - Failed game, unpayable", "hours": 7.2, "user_id": "76561197960337918", "username": "Farre", "products": 854, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false},

The gameplay is boringly generic and offers nothing new to the genre, which is considerable given how revolutionary Duke Nukem 3D was back in the day, whilst the graphics and humour are both horrible outdated; some textures date back as far as 2005 - a whole 7 years before the finalised product - and the environments aren't particularly pleasent to look out. The humour is also extremely poor despite Jon St. John's performance which is, as it was in the original games, fantastic - but the lines he delivers feel a decade past their sell-by date.\nIn short Duke Nukem Forever is a horrible game that suffered from its hell in the development stage; this could have been a great old school FPS with some witty one-liners but instead suffers from a lack of identity as it tries to be a 21st century FPS whilst retaining the qualities of its heyday and just becomes a glorious mess. There's no fun and Duke Nukem will go back to its dormant state.

Now good luck playing the actually good Duke Nukem games because 3D Realms can no longer distribute Duke Nukem games). I've seen people say this 'thing' is a faithful sequel to Duke 3D, and those are the type of people that have 72 hours in Black Ops 3 Multiplayer and 0.2 in Duke Nukem 3D. So you can make your own opinion on those people.\nLevel Design:\nDuke Nukem 3D's level design was open, it allowed you to enjoy the level in your own way and find secrets. DN:F's level design is about as open as a mole's eyelid and about inspired as CoD 4's Multiplayer Map, Shipment. I tried exploring but it was just so 'chore like' so i stopped trying. From the levels I played, I found only one secret (in the first level) and it was being able to... pick up a soggy turd and throw it around the room. Probably put there to reflect the gameplay.\nGameplay:\nEnemies in Duke 3D would spout blood out like a fountain and sometimes even kneel down allow you to kick them right in the face. DN:F's enemies have less blood shooting out of them but when their body parts go flying you feel like you can take the world... Until you run into the horrid checkpoint system, sometimes putting you at the beginning of levels and some times through the actual floor. Enemies may have an interesting gib system but it doesn't make up for how they just become bullet sponges and on higher difficulties kill you quite fast.\nOverall Duke Nukem: Forever is a clunky mess with outdated, childish humour, taking you through phallac alien hives with hanging breasts on the wall with the option to 'press x to slap' and 'tickle' a n u s looking gateways and to top it all off, end it with fighting a three boobed alien queen mith matching jiggle physics.\nDon't buy this game\nYou are better off cutting paper with your eyelids", "hours": 11.5, "username": "Cakekake", "products": 276, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Theres alot of bad in this game and there is some good. I will review this game on a pro/con style and go into detail as to why i think this game is horrible. Mind you i beat it on easy and near end on an insane difficulty play through.\nPro:\n\nTheres♥♥♥♥♥♥...thats kinda nice. (im really scratching the end of the barrel with that one trying to come up with some possitives)\nSome humor is pretty funny but thats far and few between. Most of the time you get some forced one liner.\nCons: (There are alot)\nI could easily say everthing is a con in this game but that would be too easy.\nThe story is really nonexisting. Most of the time your going from mission to mission with small bits of exposition every once in a while.\nBosses are very bullet spongy especially on insane mode. The main annoying one is the octaking and the battle lord......and the electric eel. Pretty much all the bosses suck.\nAlot of platforming; this would be a bad thing if it didnt subtract from the combat. The thing is if your taking out moments of combat to give the player some time to chill before rushing into more combat give us something like the strip club. That was a fun mission to escape combat.\nOctabrains and their telekenises. On insane mode these enemys are kinda fast and they hit like a run away ice cream truck. The main issue is that these enemys have the ability to pick up any and all objects like boxes, barrels, and other things. Thats not the issue more as they can throw back objects like rockets you shot at them dealling enough damage to insta kill you. I wouldnt complain if i wasnt being punished for what gun i had or want to use to deal with an enemy. I would be fine if rockets had reduce damage on these enemys because of their special powers slowing the rockets velocity or something while only able to fully interact with nonmovable objects.\nWater levels.That word alone should be a thumbs down unless the level is done right which for this game it did not. Whats annoying is that duke has a lung capacity of a 4yr old. Duke must swim to vents to recover oxygen as to not drown and can not forget to fight in the water with more annoying octabrains. Ill take The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time's water level any day.\nDriving is not enjoyable. Mainly driving the monster truck was just a huge pain because of how light it is causing it to flip over alot of times. Not a big deal but those moments tend to drag on especially when you run out of gas and need to find more.\nA few times the game has a dodge this moment like runing up a set of stairs while an enemy is throwing barrels down the stairs or duke driving the monster truck up a mountain while boulders are rolling down. These objects deal massive damage and it can lead to alot of frustation due to fighting controls or the level its self.\nConclusion:\nThis is one of those games where you shouldnt play because of how bad and bland it is. When you get to a bs moment the game is completely unfair which i know from experience that all the issues of the game become more visable when you play a harder difficulty. This game you can see the flaws on easy mode. Bosses can only be damaged with rpgs or some type of explosive devices which is a tad pain since you need to trade a gun you have to carry an rpg and switch it out  again. I say pass on this game and get something better perferably with a better story and game mechanics.

{"product_id": "57900", "page": 136, "page_order": 0, "recommended": false, "date": "2016-07-28", "text": "A stunning and unnecessary letdown.\nLike many gamers of my age-range I have a very personal connection with this game since I have been waiting for it for more than a decade and on top of that I have avoided playing DNF since its surprising actual release in 2011 until now when I got it via humblebundle. Suffice to say the release of Duke Nukem Forever feels like a historical event. When it was first announced back in 1997 I was in elementary school. A lot has changed in my life, in the world, in gaming since then. It's been so long you could basically make a wonderful period piece about the late-nineties because that era of gaming is obscured to many active gamers just by virtue of their late birth, just as the dawn of gaming is shrouded in mystery for me. It's almost impossible to describe in words what images flash before my eyes when I think of that time. Polygons came and swept everyone away, 3D accelerators arrived and did the same to everyone's wallet. Memories of marveling at the prowess of 3Dfx cards and saving my pocket money to buy the 64mb of RAM required to play Star Trek Elite Force. Hours of sweaty desperation spent trying to translate the levels I had drawn in school into the Build Engine in a time before I was able to properly (or rather barely) speak english - I think it's necessary to underline these precious memories a bit so you can properly understand my frustration and disappointment with this title, because it's so very easy to grab me by the nostalgia gonads and yank my wallet around by it, yet DNF failed to do so.\nThrough subsequent years and countless 3D engines DNF frequently occasionally reared its ugly stubborn head, changing faces numerous times. Around 2003/4 it seemed even somewhat finished with an intriguing trailer that put it right up there with other FPS of the new millenium like Timesplitters, Red Faction, XIII and the likes. The years gone-by saw the rise of fluent console first person shooters, endless retreads of \"tactical\" shooters like the Call of Duty series and the development of most gaming genres coming to a grinding halt. DNF could have been a sparkling beacon of the virtues of times past.\nWe have to move back in time a few years to understand why DNF was such a letdown. It might seem obvious that about 14 years of anticipation could never be matched but I think that anticipation has been overrated when it comes to the critical reception of this game. In the 90s the first-person shooter ruled supreme. In hindsight it's hard to imagine but back then it was one of the (maybe even\n) most creative and innovative genres on the PC (consoles would follow several years later because people hadn't figured out yet that you could use a dual analog-stick layout like a mouse and keyboard setup). Doom had pushed the door wide open and the genre originally titled \"Doom-clones\" went crazy with the formula the next couple of years. Level designs got more intricate/confusing and still manage to impress to this day, weapons and enemies got more outlandish and so forth. Among those many shooters from the late nineties Duke Nukem 3D and its contemporaries on the lovely Build engine like Blood, Shadow Warrior or Redneck Rampage stuck out. Technically inferior to the all-polygon competition of Quake 1 and 2 they managed to trump with intricate level design, off-beat humour, general levels of weirdness and an overall personality that has yet to meet its match. A more innocent time, buckets of gore, really dumb humour, it was\n. FPSs would ultimately lose their edge in the following years ironically by evolving. Half-Life and Unreal were shining examples of the genre taken to the next level but many of the competitors failed to grasp what made these titles so unique and just copied the formula more and more. Which is what got us to the stale First Person Shooter world of today. Of course there are always exceptions, this is just a very personal and biased recollection of the last 20 years of PC gaming by your humble narrator.\nBeing a former hardcore gamer by 2011 I was basically turned off by most mainstream titles. The crazy production values imposed on AAA gaming still prove to be a detriment to the overall quality of games and especially the willingness by creators to take risk and innovate. It was basically the time that gaming connoiseurs used to get into retro- and indie-gaming, two gifts that keep on giving. Finally enter Duke Nukem Forever. Throughout a troubled (oh what an understatement) development cycle (aka hell) there was still hope that it would triumph and personally I wished it to be amazing and even after so many years of waiting and tiredless mocking by the press (DNF = did not finish etc.) there was some hope. DNF has the attitude and braindead humour you've come to expect and love and being a relic from a different time could have worked to its benefit (just take a look at retro-styled indie games) - it didn't need to be the most innovative game of all time to succeed. I think a lot of people were merely clamoring for a fast, relentless, charmingly dumb, politically incorrect old-school FPS with loads of funny weapons, punishing difficulty, complex multi-layered levels etc. It could have worked had it stuck to its original strengths. The big problem here despite the commendable attitude and outdated but welcome style of humour Duke Nukem Forever turned out ot be a by-the-numbers contemporary FPS, painfully bland and unengaging.\nEverything boring about the standard FPS is found here. Painfully linear over-choreographed levels, an artifical two-weapon limit (why oh why? Halo wasn't\ngood), regenerating health, abundance of Checkpoints that take any challenge and punishment out of failing, unnecessary and shockingly uninspired turret sections, the list goes on. Beyond that, the basic shooting mechanics are just not fun, all the weapons lack punch and style. If DNF had been a retro throwback, warts and all, I would have commended it but what we got in the end was a bland experience, symptomatic of everything boring with current First person shooters. It makes fun of all the tropes but still uses them.\nIn the end DNF is possibly the greatest example of blue balls in the gaming world. It's a fascinating little trainwreck that should have never been released. As is, it's quite interesting to disect. You can cut through it like a tree and see all the rings, all the engine changes, remnants of changing trends in gaming, different developers who just gave up, but that doesn't make the gameplay any less tiring and mediocre. It clearly feels like an unfinished game that was left in the vault for too long, only to be slightly dusted off and subsequently released.\nThere's a scene in the first Star Trek movie where a beaming accident causes a Spock-stand-in to be horribly mangled in the process and die quickly in a grotesque blob of flesh and guts. I don't remember the exact line that was spoken there but it was something like \"What went through didn't live long, fortunately\". Almost twenty years after I first anticipated Duke Nukem Forever I can finally put its corpse to rest. Not worth anyone's time.

Nevertheless, this game was very disappointing. The game was fun early, but quickly became boring and annoying for me.\nThe main problem with this game is level design. Despite being a \"first-person shooter\" Duke Nukem Forever doesn't actually have you doing much shooting. Instead, you spend most of the game doing puzzles and completing lengthy platforming sections. Some of these sections are fun, but it gets boring after a while. The short duration of most of the game's gunfighting segments makes this problem even worse.\nDespite all of its other well-documented flaws, Duke Nukem Forever could have been a very fun game if it were a mindless, comical, action-packed, old-school shooter. But the overabundance of physics puzzles and platforming sections simply made it feel like a very cheap Half-Life 2 imitation. The glimpses of juvenile fun early in the game give way to a bogged-down chore.

You can increase Duke's Health (Ego) by interacting stuff or beat bosses.\nThose that has played Duke Nukem 3D, should know that this game also had some references, and some humors as well.

It's exactly what Duke Nukem Forever was going to be, being released when it was.\nLet me elaborate.\nDuke Nukem was always both an FPS and a meme-ridden parody. Most of the well beloved humor and quotes from D3D were quotes and references to pop culture back then, just like most of humor in DNF is quotes and references to pop culture of today (including Video Game cliches). The difference being that over time, the public opinion on such practice has shifted greatly. Mostly because now a good chunk of pop culture is related to the internet, and the internet is either very defensive or radically hateful of their \"culture\".\nAs for gameplay.\nDuke 3D was born in the era of such games as Doom and Quake. And the gameplay REFLECTED this.\nD.N.F. was released in the era of more \"cinematic\" shooters with less focus on pure running and shooting, and more focus on interaction and \"Press X to do something awesome\" prompts. And the gameplay REFLECTS this.\nI'm convinced that if DNF was released at any other time period, it would have looked differently. It could resemble Half Life 2, or the first Half-Life. Nevertheless it would still be peppered with pop culture references relevant to the time periods of when these games were popular.\nI suspect that what people wanted and expected was Duke Nukem 3D but with modern graphics, and i wouldn't mind that either, i'm with you on this one.\nHowever if i'm right about Duke Nukem games being parodies of the games popular AT THE TIME of the game's release, then this is exactly what we were supposed to get.

Releasing in June 2011 on PC, PS3 and 360, the title was 12 years in the making, and was a highly anticipated release given the popularity of the previous Duke Nukem games.\nFirst of all the gameplay is your regular run of the mill slap stick run and gun action. With Duke Nukem games, you will be used to fast paced action with tons of enemies charging at you, DNF takes a slight different approach and gives you more of an adventure style game world to explore, with plenty of dreaded platforming puzzles to solve. Within the first half an hour I was already sick to death of the amount of jumping puzzles this game had - the action is also very few and far between at times. I was really expecting mayhem from this title but was so disappointed with the honestly boring game play.\nDNF has voice acting right the way through, but most of it is just cringe worthy. You have barbie doll type girls with unfunny toilet humor most of the time, with some of the classic lines coming from Duke too. A lot of the time I found myself wincing with emotional pain listening to it; I think we’ve probably just all outgrown the Duke humor now. Visually DNF looks OK. It definitely looks like it was released in 2011, but then when you compare it to other games from that year like Skyrim, it still looks very basic. Not to mention some of the animation of character’s movements look weird as anything!\nWe do have three levels of difficulty to contend with though, which makes for veteran FPS players looking for that extra challenge can hit their spot, I couldn’t really tell a difference between the normal mode and easy mode though.  In total this game took me about eight hours to finish the story mode. The game also has a multiplayer mode, but this is virtually empty and I struggled to find a game within any sort of respectful timeframe.  Unless you are an FPS junkie, there is little need for a second playthrough, completely linear story and gameplay makes any more than one pointless.\nLike I said, this game does offer us something different from the Duke franchise. We have an explorable world on a larger scale than we are used too. With a couple of easter eggs waiting to be found on each stage, and interactive items found throughout too, the level design is definitely the game’s few positive points.\nThankfully the game seems to run OK still, I was able to ramp all the graphics settings to full, and still achieve over 100+ at all times. I did need to turn V-sync off as this gave a strange graphical bug where it looked as if the frame rate was fluctuating when it wasn’t which made me feel a little motion sick, after turning it off though, it fixed the problem. The game is most certainly best played using keyboard and mouse even though a controller is supported.\nDuke Nukem Forever had to live up to high expectations, but didn’t even come close to getting past the bare minimum unfortunately. The boring and uninteresting gameplay quite frankly was a laughable excuse for a Duke Nukem game, and the cringe worthy voice acting topped this off to be a pretty poor excuse for a game full stop. I think it’s quite cheeky from the developers to have this game still marked at £14.99 as it isn’t even worth half of that. I wouldn’t even want to recommend DNF even when it’s on sale to be quite honest with you. Sadly I think this will be the last we’ve seen from Duke, but we can all hope for a resurgence like we’ve seen from the likes of Doom and Tomb Raider in recent times.\n1) Stay away\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

First though, let's reminisce a little:\nDuke Nukem 3D was a defining pillar in the history of PC games.  With quick action, over-the-top kills, great weapon selection, always on-tap (if a bit juvenile) humour and Duke-talk smackdowns, awesome level design with a metric butt-ton of secrets and easter eggs, and delightfully hilarious multiplayer dukematches, Duke 3D absolutely nailed the first person shooter genre, and showed the world what was possible on the PC platform at the time.\nSo what has fifteen years of development yieded with its sequel, Duke Nukem Forever?\nGame freezes on startup, long level load times, absolutely linear levels, boring gameplay, checkpoint game-saves, player limited to carrying only 2 weapons at a time, pitiful and painfully cringe-worthy attempts at humour, and Duke now has all the personality of a limp noodle.\nEverything that made the previous game great is missing here.\nBottom line:\nF*** you Gearbox for putting out this absolutely terrible and blatantly obvious console port and s***ting on PC gamers who made this franchise great.\nA typical example of this shoddiness is the turret level.\nWhoever designed the turret level needs to be taken out back behind the barn and shot and p***ed on.  Because of no save-game feature, you WILL replay this level over and over. And over.  You'll see Duke's smashed red blood-stained sunglasses over and over too.  And be forced to wait an insulting five seconds while you stare at them before the game finally prompts you to hit Enter to reload, which takes a further ten seconds.  And then you have to start all over AT THE BEGINNING.\nIt's an exercise in frustration that is inexcusable given the fact I have the game installed on a Core-i7 machine with an SSD.  I keep saying this every time I buy a game with them, but if I wanted checkpoint saves I'd play this game on an XBox.  I bought the game on Steam, and I'm playing the game on a PC, so f*** off with the checkpoint saves and give me the ability to save the game anywhere I d*** well want.\nFinal verdict:   Not even on a Steam Sale.\nBuy Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition on GoG.\nInstall eduke32 and the HRP.

This game is not what the series deserves, this game did not deliver the hype because it just isn't right. This is a great FPS, just the wrong series to implement said gameplay.\nWith that in mind, it is a great FPS. Duke Nukem's character is usually really enjoyable, but he is mediocre in my opinion in this title. The gameplay is modern FPS mechanics, as in only two weapons may be carried and health regenerates. This is not suitable for Duke Nukem.\nThe lines are mediocre from Duke Nukem. I want to like Duke's character in this game, but I feel he is sorta missing the target just a little bit. His humor isn't god awful, but it just feels lack luster all the same.\nThe gameplay is fast paced and fun. The weapon, level, and gameplay variety isn't massive but it is a good size. There is a lot of puzzle elements which feels a bit out of placed in how they're implemented but they're not dreadfully boring. In my opinion, the puzzles would be better gone, it only slows down the action and I feel that's a mistake if it's for mediocre puzzles.\nThe entire campaign is alright. It's not amazing, it's enjoyable though. I feel like it had too many shrinked Duke levels, which is when you're shrinked to a Ken sized doll. I kinda wish it had more space levels, or any for that matter.\nThere is also online, which is actually pretty fun. Get a group of mates and you'll have a blast for a few hours.\nOverall, good game. It did not deserve the hate it got, but that's what happens when you change too much of a series' formula and hype it to death. However, the $20 price tag is attorcious. I suggest wait for a sale.  7-8/10\nPros-\nShort but enjoyable campaign\nEnjoyable gameplay\nOnline is pretty fun\nCons-\nHumor is not super hilarious, sorta meh\nLevel variety is not as good as it could be.\nPuzzle moments feels like it slows down the game, despite the puzzles being super simple\nIt is not a true Duke Nukem game, it could have been a new game series.\nPretty spendy, it is not worth the current price tag at all.", "hours": 4.8, "username": "Rex Draco", "products": 1564, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Your traditional revenue streams are hemmoraging before homoncular internet fetuses who play games in videos while making dumb faces and emitting unintelligible noises. Your editor wants clicks, but the people whose fingers you're impelling to do the clicking would have to read after they did that, and that's not what they're into. And then, like a rocket from the sky, the news emerges; Duke Nukem Forever, of all things, has been completed, and is being released. Soon.\nNobody ever actually thought this would happen, and nobody even cares anymore. Even though you weren't smart enough to get a decent job, you're smart enough to understand that it can't really live up to expectations, any more than it can recreate the experience of being 12 and seeing pixellated stripper boobs for the first time, or that feeling of power that occupying the shoes of the world's most famous narcissist can give you. That internet feminism is a thing now too, and Duke Nukem, that rascal, loves to objectify those women.\nLooks like you've got a byline, and a perfect opportunity to trash the decent work of a games studio whose work, no matter how good, could never come close to recreating the time and place that was so integral to many people's experience of D3D. So pontificate about how gaming has 'moved on' from the puerile adolescent power fantasy of Duke Nukem, and watch those revenue streams divert ever so slightly from the unintelligible homonculi you despise so much.\nI don't know what people were expecting of this game. I also played Duke Nukem 3D as a kid when I shouldn't have been, as well as the tangentially-related originals, although those were slightly more family friendly. This game can't recreate that. It was either going to be a slavish recreation of its predecessor or a faithful transliteration of that character into the (then) modern era of gaming. It is very much the former.\nWhile it irks me that modern cancers seeped into it, such as regenerating health, cover-based action, Call of Duty running, and a limited weapon loadout, these things were not integrated poorly and were very much a part of First Person Shooters at the time this game came out. Duke Nukem is the polyglot ripoff we know and love, Aliens steal his babes, and he steals the alien's lives. The aliens look great, especially the creepy Master Brains, who are translated excellently from the original. The action is well-done and the mechanics change enough to keep things interesting. And the less said about the muckraking journalists who took advantage of political convenience to bash an easy target and the good work of many people, the better.

It is true that it isn't as good as Duke Nukem 3d by any means, but calling it the worst game ever is a massive exageration. This is a game for Duke fans first and foremost. If you are a fan of Duke Nukem 3d you will get at least some enjoyment out of this game. If you have never played a Duke Nukem game before, go and get Duke 3D. 3D is a much better game,m and this will seem like another generic FPS to you.\nNow that that's out of the way, I'm going to tell you that overall I did like and enjoy the game. It has a fair bit of problems but Duke is still a fun character like he was back in 1996. This is the same Misogynistic, Evil Dead quoting idiot who drowns in narcissism. It's a joke and it's intentionally over the top, and if you find that offensive then I don't think you would even be looking at a Duke game. You could argue that Duke is a dated character that should have remained in the 90s, and that might be true, but I still think that having a shallow character fits an action game more than giving us a pretentious character who talks about how horrible killing is before going out and murdeing an entire army.\nDuke Nukem Forever is a generic modern FPS with Duke and his weapons being the only standout features. The classic arsenal is all here, we still get the Freezethrower, Devestator, and Shrink Ray . Unfortuanately you can only carry two weapons at a time, and the levels are extremely linear. Remember how in the 90s FPS you had to actually look around and find ammunition? The Developers game you the resources you needed but you had to find\nduke forever you literally can run up to a ammo crate an infinite number of times and restock on ammo. You can't even explore the levels as much as you could in 3D.  And this is one of the biggest problems. In a Duke game we should have large complex levels, instead of the simple linear ones we got. The regenerating health is also out of place, but at least they tried to justify it with Ego.\nMy other biggest problem with the game is that most of the weapons feel underpowered ESPECIALLY the Devestator. The only weapons that feel like they have actual power to them would be the shotgun and the chaingun. The rest aren't much fun to use, and you probably won't be using them.\nSo get this only if you like Duke Nukem. You will like it. If you have never heard of Duke Nukem before go and play Duke Nukem 3D, it is a much, MUCH, better game and it is one of the must-play classic FPS game of the 90s.

This game has its fair share of issues, Ill say right here this game could have been amazing I agree its not good but its not bad, figuring how to get to certain areas can be frustrating, the textures leave much to be desired, one point requires you wait for dropship and fend off enemies who drop in from their ships, once you kill like 3 you have to wait for them to drop in again (repeat) and you just want to get on with it.\nIts clearly not the duke people wanted, however if you’re not an uber fan (well even if you are Id suggest playing as it does have playability) then the dialogue in this game is worth the sale price it is a gem, the quotes, the puns, the sheer lunacy is brilliant.\nI also like the ability to interact with things like go to the loo, eat food and activate soda machines to dispense individual cans you can drink, play start of a duke porno in a dvd player, play actual air hockey with a guy, play the bandit machines etc, etc, a lot more games should add these little things as I was surprised by that, they also give you a small health boost.\nKilling pig cops by impaling them with a fork lift truck, slapping sets of triple alien boobies, and taking down some Gigantic Aliens and executing / impaling them are all good reasons why this game although not great is worth a fun play and that’s all you can say with this something to chill and have a laugh with, doesn’t take itself seriously, so if you come at it like that then yea it’s fun.\nOnce I’ve tried and finished the DLC mission, then prob won’t go back for a long while and if I did it would be for a fun few mins or a pvt multiplayer game.\nSo if the prospect of shooting Pig Cops, seeing naked chicks and completing side objective such as grabbing a vibrator, condom and snacks before a lap dance among the outright funny dialogue and big♥♥♥♥♥Alien bosses interest you then add to wish list and wait for a sale then grab It, just don’t expect great things an view it as its own little thing.", "hours": 15.9, "username": "Jon -MysticSynthwave", "products": 494, "early_access": false},

There isn't enough action in this game and it gets boring quick. I've been playing this game for 2 hours and I've had maybe 4 or 5 gun battles totalling maybe 5 minutes each. The rest of the time I'm walking and crawling from one location to the other with not a single enemy in sight. I don't think I have the patience to play this game much more.

That's what it felt like with Duke Nukem Forever even though it was closer to fifteen years in reality.\nThis game has a distinct trait that only two other games I played share with it. Those two games are Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. What do I mean by this? These three games are the only games that stick out in my mind as games I got about two hours into, forgot for a few years, and then completed. The thing is after completing Duke Nukem Forever I felt like it was more an obligation than entertainment.\nSo aliens break a treaty with Earth and capture all the women and this makes Duke go on a quest to get them back and kick alien butt. All the while you can do little things like play pool, lift weights, and admire yourself in the mirror to boost your ego so you can take more damage before your health gets affected. But don't be fooled; even on lower difficulties you still lose your Ego rather fast but it can be easily replenished by either melee killing a downed enemy or just waiting behind cover like most modern shooters which would be forgivable if this game didn't try to lampshade how \"Power armor is for (synonym for cats)\" obviously nodding to another FPS franchise that has the same health mechanics. You might have heard of it, it's a franchise that was about giant nuclear metal onion rings in space designed to kill absolutely everything in the universe which will probably never see any more releases on PC because a certain company has to try and justify supporting a certain console.\nDriving and puzzles are to be found to try and break up the monotony of shooting things in the face because why play Mario Kart or Portal when you can play DNF? The PC version allows you to turn an option on to carry a whole FOUR weapons! You can even drink beer and take steroids to give yourself buffs if you really feel like it but such actions don't feel essential. Shooting at the pig cops until they die is a valid enough strategy.\nSpeaking of what you can do, let's talk about the fluff. The intro level to the game allows you to draw on a whiteboard while a soldier speaks the same two lines of dialogue! And your drawing is inconsequential! So is the autograph you sign for a young fan! Do you like to throw human waste for no reason? What about killing yourself by sticking your finger in an electrical socket?\nFIFTEEN YEARS!\n(I think it speaks volumes when one of the most engaging activities I had was spending almost an hour on the pinball table.)\nMultiplayer itself was a fun waste of an evening or two. The most absurd sight I saw playing online was a few guys who obviously spent too much time on the game telling everyone in the match to buy the DLC during the Summer Sale. Maybe if I was even worse with my money than I actually am right now I would have, but it was a novelty and scratched that shooter itch I keep having to deal with.\nI think game historians will look back on a game like Duke Nukem Forever and examine it critically, and then look at a game like the newest Doom and wonder how one company could have messed up so bad at trying to modernize an iconic franchise. When I see Duke Nukem as a whole, I can see some potential. Duke is rusty, a reflection of old 80's and 90's macho man types who fought the bad guys and always got the girl. I feel this game had to be released so he coul stretch his legs. The prospect of a new Duke Nukem game fills me with such glee in the amount of outrage he could cause in today's society.\nGood luck getting that out of Gearbox though.", "hours": 11.1, "username": "Ryoko's Stepdad", "products": 54, "early_access": false},

DNF was nothing but a Frankenstein's monster of mishmashed gaming concepts which had proven popular in the years and years the game spent in development limbo - in GOOD games. Like Counter-Strike, or Half-Life, or Halo. The vehicle segments were buggy and boring. The combat was braindead. The Duke quips were 14 years out of place. The levels were uninspired, as was the level progression, and the game's one true callback to the original was a juvenile level full of alien anuses that culminated in fighting a three titted alien who took zero effort whatsoever to kill. There weren't even strip clubs or nudey mags, or keys, and the captured human women were irrelevant (I'm not counting the mandatory, ridiculously bad strip club intermission level).\nThe fact that this game has 70% positive reviews would be amazing, if it weren't simply more proof that gamers have no taste.

The gameplay is mediocre, unsatisfying and generally not fun. There's no exploration in the levels, no secrets and nothing beyond linearity. The weapons handle badly and are limited to a two or four weapon limit, but the levels have all been designed with a two-weapon limit in mind, which means no ammo and the mandatory use of some weapons in certain sections. The game wastes its energy with a poorly written, poorly thought out story that shouldn't even be there. The graphics are horrid and the post-processing (which is the only way to make it look decent) will ruin your eyesight. Seriously. The multiplayer isn't much to write home about, either - it's based on the singleplayer so you have the same terrible weapons, and the level design is generally pretty awful.\nThe fact that Gearbox considered this fit for release tells you volumes about what sort of developer they are. And the fact that 3D Realms went from a perfectly great game ready for release in 2007-2008, to spend even more time and money to port this game to consoles, redoing all the levels and mechanics so it'd play best on an Xbox, tells you much about how this game ended up taking over 14 years in development.

My cousin Doug introduced me to Duke Nukem a long time ago, back when dial-up was a thing.  I loved the game, but I was terrible at it.  FPS was never my thing.  I played a re-release on the XBox360 and beat the original campaign.  I felt the waves of nostalgia and still remember a late-night conversation with a friend about \"What if there was another Duke Nukem game?\"  I was never very good at it, but I wanted to see Duke at least have a last ride.\nThis is it.  When I first heard about it, I pre-ordered.  When I heard Gearbox was involved, I was excited.  When I played, it was fantastic!  I don't care about the hate.  Duke Nukem was a spoof from the beginning, looking hardcore.  Some of us as kids didn't know that he was the poster child of the 80's and early 90's.  We were just excited about the graphics being the best we'd ever seen, and having blood in a game!  He still makes comments like he used to, though by now it's not so much a gimmick as it used to be.  He still has a sweet weapon set, and he's saving the day.  I am not bothered by a linear level layout or a regenerating health bar.  Gearbox made this game playable for CASUAL gamers like me.  For what little story there was, I loved it.  The DLC was a blast.  The pinball was fun.  And as far as PC is concerned, it was a blast beating the game on its hardest difficulty by setting the in-game speed to 50%.  I've never had so much fun racing and beating bosses in Slow Motion.  ^_^\nThere are better shooting games out there if you're into that.  If you want one with a character that couldn't keep up with the times and looks like a relic of an earlier era, here it is.  Duke Nukem fans need to realize he was a parody then, and he still is...it's just more clear now.  He's not a character that grows or matures, and maybe that's sad for some of us who have young memories of him.  Don't forget what Duke Nukem was BEFORE Duke Nukem 3D.

It was probably not the best for their reputation as the game is average through and through. Die graphics is roughly on the same level as Half-Life 2, without the great systems for animations and facial expressions. It follows the blueprint of a classic first person shooter, which includes puzzles in the levels whch are all well done. The rest ist mostly standard fps level design, only in very few instances the genius level design which made Duke3D a masterpiece shines through. I noticed that quite a lot of arenas are in the game, where the player is trapped and has to defend multiple waves of enemies. The weapons are part standards like a pistol and a shotgun and part crazy weapons like the ice- and shrinkray, but nothing that veterans of Duke3D aren't familar with. But they are not as effective (or should I say: overpowered?) as their counterparts in the predessesor. Since only four weapons can be equipped at the same time (two if the option is deactivated), I decided not go for the exotic weapons but more for the standards to be prepared for most situations. The number of emeny types is quite low, also mostly well known foes. But their behaviour has change quite a bit, making them a new challenge. But some more different ones would have been good. The driving stages are no highlight as especially the buggy with its huge tires is a agile as a rubber boat. The game has though bossfights, which range from very good like the one against the alien queen (which does not only require fast fingers but a bit of thought) to average like the one against the Octaking.\nBut that can be the summary for the whole game: nothing is really bad, but the highlights are far and few, making the whole game quite average.

Hey, Steam told me to update it so here we go\n🔵 Pros\n+ Duke Nukem\n+ Return of Duke's iconic arsenal and his voice actor\n+ Pacing and story telling is identical to the Half-Life series\n+ Variety\n+ Women\n🔴 Cons\n- Outdated graphics\n- 70% (or less) of the actual DNF 2009 we could've gotten before 3DR's financial crisis\nWhen you search \"developmental hell\" on Google, the first thing you'll see is Duke Nukem  (no joke you should try it lol). A sequel to the cult classic Duke Nukem 3D, Duke Nukem Forever, was in development hell for 14 years: from 1997 to its release date in 2011. The main reason for this development hell was the owners of Duke Nukem Forever felt that the game on their hands was not good enough, so they kept adding, changing and delaying the game to the point that they ran out of money which ultimately led to their bankrupcy.  In 2009, the rights to the Duke Nukem franchise were sold to Gearbox Software, who eventually completed the game and released it in 2011.\n🎮 Gameplay\nDuke Nukem is a first person shooter that borrows a lot of the pacing and story telling of Half-life and gunplay of modern shooters. The game alternates between in \"survive the ambush\", puzzles/platforming, driving, and boss fights much like Half-life. The two weapon limit, regenerating health and sprinting is borrowed from modern shooters. Later, Gearbox decided to enable the four weapon limit but I found that the original two weapon system worked better; it had me running out of ammo and struggling to find another weapon on the floor, which brings some excitement. Most bosses have to be taken down by explosives and turrets, yet you can take out a regular sized enemy when you're a little Duke with a normal weapon. No mighty boot, but you can smack your enemies with your gun with the melee key.\n🤝 Multiplayer and Community\nMy Community\nfor Duke Nukem Forever Multiplayer\nThe game still has people playing regularly to this day. Steam charts report ~30 people that still play. However, community is so sensitive to \"good players\" that they just accuse everyone of being hackers. This game does have a pretty cruel history on hackers. Hacks like the ripper hacks and speed hack were dominating the multiplayer in the past and with no real support there's nothing people can do expect live with the agony. Now to this day, the hackers seemed to have died out. Literally in the case of Grumpy, the most notorious hacker in the game died of cancer a few years back. You might see people play with the tag \"GBF\" beside their names, which stands for Grumpy's Best Friend to pay respect to him. Now the community still has some smack talk but not as toxic as what it once was because the 'real' hackers had left the scene\nA level system is in the game, where you gain experience from killing opponents, complete challenges to unlock different clothing for your Duke and items your Digs. Customize Duke to your unique choosing and have him wear a Jester's hat with 3D glasses and a nice skull shirt. Leveling also unlock babes in your dig which you could talk to, and have an amusing conversation. Challenges are fastest ways to level up, stuff like \"Kill X amounts of players with Y gun\" or \" Run X miles.\"\n📖 Story\nAside from having his long-awaited sequel turning out like this, the events of this game would've been Duke's darkest hour had DNF been any other game. The aliens came back hungry for revenge, destroyed everything the protagonist built for the past 12 years in a matter of hours (Lady Killer, Duke Dome, Duke Burger), killed everyone he cared about (the Holsom twins, at least), being unable to save almost everyone he encounters (\"Not even I can save you now\" in The Hive, among many others) even though they all depended on him to protect them and believed he could do anything, getting knocked out all the damn time, and the President blaming him for the alien attack so logically speaking, the people who lost their family members to Pregnators/Pigcops would be angry at him for letting all this happen.\nBut since this is Duke Nukem, everyone is happy that he kicked the aliens' asses again and cheered for Duke(inator) to be President. I know he's a badass and all and these things don't bother him, but his adventures turned from happy-family-friendly to bloody-ultra-violent real fast between DN2 and DN3D. Now I wonder if he steals one-liners and has women between his arms and legs every night is because he wants to hide his pain (of that, as well as not getting any good games since Manhattan Project).\n💰 Content & Pricing\nPriced at $20 as base tag, and takes around 8-9 hours to finish the first playthrough. A completionist will take around 20 hours to complete. The game includes two dlcs $10 each. One is a set of 4 new multiplayer maps, paradying other game maps; namely Call of Duty, Doom, Team Fortress and Sandbox. The other one is a 3 hour singeplayer campaign featuring a more mature character of Duke Nukem and couple new weapons. It also comes with 4 new multiplayer maps and game modes.

With♥♥♥♥♥♥and explosions.\nWell being that was just reaching puberty this sounded wonderful. I was hooked, like everyone who played DN3D I was a fan for life. To this day I can go back and enjoy it the same as I did on day one. But this isn't about DN3D, this is about Duke Nukem Forever. And the introduction is the base problem.\nI just drowned in nostalgia over Duke, and expected a game in development hell for over a ♥♥♥♥ing decade was going to be anything similar. I didn't just buy Duke Nukem Forever, I pre-ordered. I spent a whopping amount of money on the initial release on console, (Xbox 360), only to be greeted with a two weapon limit, dodgy graphics and horrible load times that made Gen 1 PS1 games look fast. It was awful.\nI sold Duke Nukem Forever soon after reaching the \"Octaking\" boss, but was gifted the game and DLC by a long time friend who wanted to make sure \"I gave it a fair shot\"\nHe was right.\nThe PC version of DNF is substantially better. Does this mean it's a great game? No. It's not. But it's something many games fail to be these days. Fun. It's a good game. Not great. Good. It's like 7 dollar 4 hour porno DVDs you buy from the gas station with a pack of jerky and a six pack. You know it's not going to be the prettiest or cleanest thing, but you get your fun out of it and you didn't have to spend a lot.\nIf Duke Nukem Forever had been released in it's current form with DLC for a lower price point no one would be complaining as much as they are. But first impressions are everything. And I can honestly say - yeah. I hated it when it came out. I hated the turret sections (Though, I like the monster truck, Gearbox driving is never a bad time) I hated the attempts to out-edge the original Duke Humor (The twins are just outright cringe worthy). Shadow Warrior is a much better example of how to update a classic FPS to the modern day. Same with Rise of the Triad. I just feel like Duke Nukem got too big for it's britches.\nIf I were to rate the original game, no DLC, no patches. It's a 1/10. Easily. It's up there with♥♥♥♥♥♥games like Cosmic Race or Bubsy 3D.\nBut the PC version, with improved textures and lighting, better weapon capacity, and overall a more pleasant experience? It's a 6/10.\nI recommend Duke Nukem Forever for the sheer fact that it's a lesson in how not to develop a game. Passing it off to a bunch of people like a Thai ladyboy at a bachelor party to whoever wants to take a shot at it next. In the end we're all left a little dirtier and devoid a few bucks.

I have heard about it here and there on my time on the internet but I never played the original till two years ago. This game is infamous for its 10 year development cycle. The game has been scrapped many times and unfortunately this is the weakest out of all the rebirths. The 1998 trailer and the 2000s one looked much more fun than the final product. Does that mean the final product is a horrible game?\nWho am I kidding it's not great but not bad.\nStory:\n10 years after you defeated the aliens in Duke Nukem 3D they come back to take revenge. They take the women and Duke's steady girlfriends (yes that is plural). You are placed in many interesting situations in your quest to take out the aliens. In one part you are shrunk and have to use a race car to traverse a casino, in another you have to find three items for a stripper so she can perform a lap dance, the list goes on but what I am trying to say is that the game is not a typical shooter.\nGameplay:\nThis is unfortunately a regenerating health linear shooter. No maze like levels or health packs. The health system is unique. You can gain more health by defeating bosses or interacting with certain world objects. Some actions that will give you health are: urinating, benching, shooting a basket, getting a highscore on a pinball game, and much more. Unfortunately you only see these in the first half of the game. As far as I know the second thirds of the game have practically no ego boosts other than the bosses. Another bummer is that while the first two halves of the game are interesting (for the situations I have stated) the final third takes place in the corridor heavy Hoover Dam. It is very dull compared to the rest of the game. Imagine if Duke Nukem 3D's third episode took place in a dull military base. People would be mad. Also in the dessert there is a minecart area and it is ridiculously short. The trailers made it out to be longer with more action. But you don't kill anyone in it.\nYour enemy variety is low. Most are pigs but you will occasionally find flying teleporting aliens, shielded ones, and octabrains. It would have been nice to go after assassins hired by the corrupt president (like Bombshell in the first trailer). Instead you get the same old same old.\nThe weapon system got a lot of controversy because you could only carry two weapons. They have an option in this version to carry 4. The weapons are not very good mostly because of the lack of enemy variety. You use any random weapon without consequences. The rocket launcher only holds 5 rounds (Picard shame pic) and the ripper is just as weak as it was in Duke Nukem 3D. The rail gun is an interesting weapon because it kills most enemies in 2 shots. You can also quickfire pipes and tripwire mines with a bound key. A big disappointment is that the Freeze Ray is ridiculously weak. I unloaded an entire clip on an enemy and he still would not freeze.\nSurprisingly some people play multiplayer and DNF supports dedicated servers. It is pretty fun and you get the cool weapons from the game and more like the Expander.\nConclusion:\nThe first two thirds of this game are interesting. I only played to the end after I reached the Hoover Dam because I just wanted to say \"I beat a game that was in development for 10 years\". Duke Nukem is still a cool character and I did play all the way through despite its flaws. It is definitely a game that most will enjoy but there are many better shooters than this like F.E.A.R. and Half Life.

While not the spawn of Satan DNF really does suck and as of now this is the only Duke Nukem game currently available on Steam as Gearbox removed the original and it's superb Steam Workshop enabled Megaton port. Hail to the Pitchford baby. While not the worst game of all time it is CERTAINLEY the worst sequal. Mediocre at best, Duke Nukem Forever is as boring as it is shallow and ugly.\nIt would rather make fun of games better than it (Even if I don't like them) than put in the effort to actually BE fun or rely on it's own personality. Stranger yet the core gameplay from start to finish actually unironically imitates \"popular\" linear shooters of the time and in turn is worse than even those it mocks or imitates *COUGH* COD *COUGH* to begin with. There are \"jokes\" but it doesn't matter how many there are if none of them are funny. the biggest joke of all is Call of Dukey: Forever Warfare itself. That's only one of the things working against it though.\n(For the record the photo at the top of the review was taken with the max settings) Sometimes bad visuals are fine so long as your game runs smoothly or has an interesting art style but part of DNF's performance comes from it's super empty levels, undetailed level geometry, basic models, actual lack of antialiasing and it's terrible textures (Still stutters though and takes a while to load a whole lot of nothing even if you use an SSD like I did).The post proccessing is so bad it's as if it was meant to be a joke in minute long Unity game full of dank memes as it is quite literally as if I am looking through sweat and vasoline. You may think that while not graphically pleasing it may at least be asthetically pleasing in terms of designs or the color pallete but don't let the screenshots on the store page fool you. The basic colors you'll see 80 percent of the game are brown, yellow, red and maybe some beige. I'm told that the final chapter is green but I have not reached that chapter on the dreadful console version as♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes and sewer themed space levels don't appeal to me and I quit at the underwater segment below the dam.\nThe few returning weapons from Duke 3D either look unintentionally cartoony (With the exception of the Ripper) in the 3D transition,have been made cartoony via bad \"gritty\" redesigns or are unrecognizeable. Some may say \"Well it's a retro shooter\" but that's shot down with the words \"regenerating health\", \"turret sequence\", \"forced walking\" \"unskippable cutscenes\", \"weapon limit\" and \"quick time events\". In fact in terms of overall design if you are nostalgic for or consider chest high walls, turret sequences, QTE's, unskippable cutscenes, forced walking, a 2 weapons limit (That was patched) and badly designed vehicle sections retro then Duke Nukem Forever is perfect. I would reccomend Duke Nukem 3D Megaton instead but Gearbox took it down so they could sell a port with less content and the word \"bazinga\".

I heard the developers kept scrapping each current project when a new game engine was released, rebuild for the new one only to do the same once a NEWER engine was announced.  This is really telling and goes back to my early point that these developers started working on this project during a simpler time in \"shooter game design\".  There was still an audience for ultra-violent, silly shooters that were devoid of puzzles, platforming or paid DLC.\nBasically an \"early 90's shooter ethos\" mixed with an \"updated\" engine minus time/patience to polish off the jaggedly, crap-covered edges equals Duke Nukem Forever.\nRest in piece, Duke.

I was just feeling the cheapness of the game and then I looked beside me after I had to get out of the headache inducing sounds of the RC car that kept sounding like it was stopping and starting all because I let go of the accellerator just so I could slow down a bit... Oh yeah that's right.. I looked beside me after that:\nA god damn POT PLANT has the EXACT same TEXTURE as the WALL beside it. The development of this game was so rushed and lazy that I just can't seem to pull some enjoyment out of it... Lets just get started here on a review of this game before it makes me more cross.\nI knew for years this was supposed to be released... When it finally was I had lost interested by that point and never purchased it till I saw it on sale for $5.99. I had no real expectations of the game...\nThe introduction is terrible.\nI found myself doing menial tasks in completely non combat areas that had no enemies in site nor around any corner... Duke was talking to some dumb tarts who looked like they were in school uniforms... That's so not duke, Duke has bikini babes not school girls... Not that I have an issue with either, I'm just saying... This game is so far out of theme from Duke that it hurts my soul.\nWhen I hopped in the RC Car for the first time it had me making my way through some non-sensical layed out level through a cinema of sorts which is long and windy and had only one or 2 enemies that were 10 times my size and walked slower than I did... Which completely makes no sense considering I was the size of his foot.\nThe ramps in the cinema driving area were perfectly placed, knocked on their side advertising boards.. pretty much every jump was this except for a few raised areas of carpet which looked like someone swept♥♥♥♥♥♥lumps under the carpet and just left them there... Other pillars in the way were things like ... Actual building pillars ... Like they were duplicated from the wall and just rotated and shoved in your way so you could go around them.\nThe level design just so poor... ... so poor.\nThis game was not made out of passion for Duke 3D or gaming in general... This game really feels like a business decision and a quick churn out of some bland assets, poorly coded AI and just lazy design throughout the whole game.\nI hoped to get into this game and just run and gun... That is NOT the case... Much of the \"puzzling\" in this game is just filler and time wasting crap that adds nothing to the game.\nExtremely disappointed... This game as it stands is too boring in the first few levels to indicate that any decent gameplay could be lurking around the corner...\nIt's possible, but I highly doubt it.... Just like it's possible you could just trip on a gold nugget in your back yard.\nI kept playing to try write more review but the levels make no sense and you just stumble into the exits eventually.... If I actually enjoyed the game then making way to exits would be more enjoyable.. It wasn't that I couldn't find my way around.. It was more like.. I just could be bothered. Looking around was just so boring that going forward looked the same as going backwards... If you turned around you'd probably not know you were going in the wrong direction apart from the fact that you were probably stuck at a previous part being bored that you'd probably know not to accidentally go backwards... But who knows in this shoddy game... >.<\nThis game is just ♥♥♥♥ and should have never been released till someone could do it right... People say that it would never live up to expecations. I didn't really have expectations especially after all the reviews that crapped all over this game. But it didn't even live up to my negative expecations either... It was worse than that\n1/10 and only because the game is \"complete\" ...

I have been playing for about an hour and I can confirm it sucks, which is a real shame becuase i used to play Duke Nukem 3D over and over.\nWhy its so bad\n1. The game play is one set piece after another, the game has no flow at all.\n2. Loading time everytime you die is really slow\n3. Most of the fighting is in single rooms where enemies just teleport in one after another, there is no place for tactics, just running in circles shooting\n4. Only two guns at once...??????\n5. The Humour is so bad it gets anoying,\n6. The graphics are just awful ,especially the effects, which prevent you from seeing anything, turn them off and you can at least see where you are going\n7. Duke moves so slow! you can run, but only about 5 steps before he starts weezing like an old man.\nThe main issue really is that the game has none of the fast paced action of Duke Nukem 3D, none of the fun, none of the flow...The game is much more like one of those arcade machine shooters / dungeon crawlers were the walking forward is done for you and you just shoot at monsters on the screen in set piece after set peice.\nReally, don't even buy this out of curiousity", "hours": 1.9, "user_id": "76561197972336080", "username": "Impossimole", "products": 82, "early_access": false},

For example, I got shot through a building or wall multiple times.\nThe controls are unweildy at times. When on the dukeburger level, I touched the conrner of a box and bounced at a diagnoal midway across the room to my death.\nSpeaking of death, some of the checkpoints (particulary where the controls are aweful,) aren't any good. Why not just let us save?\nSeveral areas are just boring and repetitive. Stand here and shoot for several minutes.\nDefinitely moves away from the original in some of the worst ways.\nThe difficulty settings feel weird and untrue sometimes (caveat: limited experience with that).\nEDIT: Forgot about getting stuck on terrain and invisible walls!

How could any game possibly be worth waiting 14 years for, especially one that only ever aspired to be a low-brow comedy first-person shooter? There's no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur. More than anything, Duke just wants to party like it's 1997.\nCheck unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers before you even consider buying this suddenly corporeal ghost of PC gaming history. The development-time-to-awesomeness ratio isn't impressive. If you can do that, Duke Nukem Forever can at least mostly succeed in its aspiration. After all of its tumultuous history, it's ended up as an entertaining FPS wrapped in juvenile, smut-laced humor. Its gameplay is a hybrid of old-school and new, and it won't wow players with stunning visuals—its window of opportunity for that passed years ago—but it does put on a good show of alien♥♥♥♥♥kicking by working what it's got.\nThe Cycloid is one of the cooler-looking bosses, but his bark is worse than his bite.\nLike a hyper-violent, over-sexed Peter Pan, Duke Nukem refuses to grow up. Though 12 years have passed since the events of Duke Nukem 3D, he's the exact same trash-talking, cigar-chomping, muscle-bound man of action, still rocking that '90s-style buzz cut and red tanktop. The source of his superhuman action-hero powers is his own ego, which doubles as a literal recharging shield over his (also recharging) health. It's reinforced by an entire world of people who worship him as an infallible man-god and sex idol—women want him, men want to be him. He's the stereotypical teenage boy's power fantasy personified and turned up to 11. Sure, he's a ham-fisted action hero parody, but Duke remains one of the most memorable characters in gaming history for a reason: he's simply more fun to play as than SERIOUS FACE ARMY MAN.\nAs two-dimensional as Duke himself, the story gets right to the point: intergalactic sex-criminal aliens are re-offending, and Duke must defy orders and step in to defend Earth's chicks. Even that flimsy B-movie tribute plot is resolved (sort of) half way through—DNF becomes simply about shooting aliens 'cause they're ugly, and bits of the script are little more than profane Mad Libs. Lazy writing or pointed critique of the state of story in first-person shooters? I prefer to think of it as the latter.\nIncoming canned goods!\nReloaded\nAction-wise, the single-player game fulfills its obligations as a successor to Duke Nukem 3D. It's fast-paced run-and-gun battle against diverse, love-to-hate 'em monsters, using weaponry ranging from conventional boomsticks toover-the-top sci-fi, and fought through a long series of corridor levels where there's almost always something unique to see and interact with. Almost every original weapon (except Duke's boot) returns—and after taking the Shrink Ray and Freeze Beam for a spin, it makes me wonder why few shooters have appropriated the joy of killing enemies in two-step attacks. Sure, shrinking enemies and then squashing them or freezing and shattering isn't as efficient as double-tapping to the head, but it's more fun. There's also the Devastator, a ridiculously powerful, double-barreled, rapid-fire rocket launcher that never pauses to reload until it's spent.\nI just want to be looooooved!\nDuke's trusty pistol, shotgun, Ripper chaingun, and rocket launcher may not be anything particularly unique or special (and certainly not realistic, lacking even a hint of recoil) but they're loud and potent alien killers. The new weapons, a rail gun sniper rifle, an alien laser, and a triple-missile-launcher called the Enforcer Gun are pretty ho-hum—no new classics here. The biggest sadness is that DNF has adopted the Halo-style two-weapon system, which frequently forced me to abandon my beloved Shrink Ray for lack of ammo. Even with all of that heavy weaponry, I still died quite a bit—despite the regenerating health system, Duke Nukem Forever is one of the more challen­ging shooters I've played in years.\nAt least the signature remote-detonating pipe bombs, laser tripwire mines, and Holo-Duke decoys (plus melee-enhancing steroids and pain-mitigating beer powerups) exist outside this limitation, allowing you to set all manner of devious traps in the diverse range of linear, corridor-style levels and lure enemies into them. Duke battles the aliens through his high-tech Duke Cave, his self-styled opulent casino, the aliens' disgustingly organic hive (complete with Prey-style sphincter doors that open when tickled), a Vegas skyscraper, a Dukeburger restaurant, Hoover Dam, construction sites, Nevada canyons, underwater, and more.\nThis little piggy is coming for blood.\nOh yeah, and there's a shameless strip club level with no combat—it's mostly a showcase for boobs and a playground for the many interactive games (pinball, air hockey, billiards, video poker) and gross-out moments in the bathroom. No two settings are alike, and with plenty of Easter eggs scattered around that boost your health when interacted with, exploring the world is a frequently rewarding high point.\nBlast from the past\nAt the end of these levels lie some old-school-tough boss battles. Almost all of the hulking beasts took me out at least once before I figured out and exploited their attack patterns (notable exception: the final boss). Fights against a mothership, a massive alien queen, an underwater leech, and others are more about the spectacle of fighting huge unique monsters (plus an excuse for Duke to nut-punch something for an ego boost) than creating interesting gameplay.\nIt's Duke vs. Goliath.\nThe old-style design is probably due to the fact that DNF should've come out years ago. (Hell, 2K's recommended PC is built from five-year-old hardware.) Here and there, it shows; while alien monsters look pretty cool—particularly the iconic Pig Cops and flying, tentacled Octabrains—humans and many of the environments look well behind the curve. But thanks to the aliens' comical massacre of EDF (Earth Defense Force) troops, you don't spend a lot of time looking at people, so it only really offends when the incompetent President waves his unarticulated fingers in your face.\nPop culture references are similarly out-of-date—even growing moldy. Considering that the freshest ones I caught date back all the way to 2004's Team America: World Police (excluding reenactment of Christian Bale's 2009 meltdown in the opening and a crack at Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare tacked on at the end), most of Duke's one-liners were probably recorded in the early half of last decade. Though Duke still delivers several chuckles per level by quoting '90s films like Pulp Fiction and Starship Troopers and jabbing at Halo, it's noticeable that he's been living under a rock for quite some time.\nEh, it's Vegas. They were probably going to tear that hotel down and build a bigger one anyway.\nMeatheaded\nI encountered a lot more puzzles (of the jumping, physics, and switch-throwing varieties) than I'd expected, and few are befitting of Duke. Dropping barrels into one end of a shipping container to tilt it and create a ramp is too mundane a task for a super badass—Duke's not making fun of the puzzles other shooters started using a decade ago here, he's imitating them. Poorly.\nThe more innovative puzzle gimmick is shrinking Duke down to a few inches tall and sending you scurrying through levels made for man-sized play. Being action-figure sized gives you a new and interesting perspective on the world—jumping around a vast kitchen battling rats and mini Pig Cops among the shelves while using mustard jars as cover is a very different experience, and one encounter in particular makes an epic battle of what would normally be a one-shot kill. However, running any significant distance on tiny legs can get tedious.\n80/100", "hours": 2.8, "username": "Harley", "products": 241, "found_funny": 7, "early_access": false},

The writing is pretty awful most of the time and the jokes are a collection of time capsules full of internet memes ranging from Team America quotes to things that even people at the time the memes were popular might not recognize like GI Joe PSA Edit references, and some of the gameplad setpieces just aren't fun at all, like one where you have to drive a monster truck through a level and constantly stop to get gas. But when it does do things right, DNF is a passable shooter, and if nothing else it's at least fairly interesting in its design. The 10 years of development show very obviously, and the game is pretty much a random collection of ideas thrown into a game, so you never know whether you'll be shrunk down to size jumping through a Rats version of the Duke Burger kitchen or sent to a strip club to collect items for a dancer. The thing that this game is most notable to me for is the almost excessive level of interaction in the environment; you can use microwaves, poke power outlets, and more. You can probably name any number of FPSs that are more fun than DNF, but I doubt you can name one that not only lets you use the water cooler, but also individually switch on either the cool or uncool water. The result is that the best parts of the game are the parts where you aren't actually in combat, and can just enjoy the environment and find all the things you can do in it. It doesn't make up for the rest of the game's frequent mediocrity, but it's something that I wish more games did.\nIt's worth noting that the DLC, The Doctor Who Cloned Me, was not made by 3D Realms, and as such it's a lot better. It still has a few pitfalls, like the return of Dylan, one of the worst characters in gaming history, and the final boss is a bit of a letdown (the boss in the middle of the DLC is a better fight, really), but it's actually funny for the most part and parodies things that are more relevant to the time it released compared to the original, and the campaign as a whole is more fun than DNF. It's decent enough that it's worth the $5 or so the collection goes down to when it's on sale. DNF as a whole isn't a game that you should buy at full price, but it's not the Big Rigs of its generation like people will try to convince you it is.", "hours": 47.2, "username": "Jocosity", "products": 1248, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

I played it a few years back on the 360 and hated it... the load times were abysmal, I died a lot (especially toward the end) and it didn't mirror the cool graphics of the game I saw a person on Youtube showoff (later I would find out it was the PC version, which has marginally better graphics)\nFast foreward a few weeks and I manage to obtain a version of the game (don't ask me how :P) and play through the game on all four difficulties. I always had a forgiving nature of notriously bad games, and this is no exception. Gameplay can be fun (if highly unfair later on Insane difficulty) and addicting.\nI am not blind to its faults.

You will learn to hate most of the game's turret levels (the one at the beginning of The Mighty Foot is not that bad) and the Octoking, Pool minigame, (This mini game needs to die in a fire...) Energy Leech, and the Mothership are some of the most annoying aspects of the game.\nIgnoring challenge (as it is very much possible if highly frustrating) this game is quite fun. I never grew up with Duke Nukem and wouldn't even play M rated games cause my parents were restrictive till much later. There are some questionable moments (The infamous Hive level... though I am personally not bothered by this level... shows how horrible a person I am) and the gameplay is unfairly hard at moments (Crash Course I am looking at you) but if you give it a try and don't let people's overwhelmingly negative opinions about things affect your enjoyablity of games, then this game can be quite the fun experience.\nA fun thing to do once you beat the game on all four difficulties is to cheat. Unlimited ammo + Unlimited Health + Insta Gib = absolute god mode and revenge against all the brutal segments that this game has to offer. OctoKing give you a hard time during Insane? Why not turn on unlimited health and Insta Gib and laugh as he falls into bloody chunks.\nThis game isn't as bad as people say and I get that it is about disapointment over the hype, but I haven't experienced that hype and didn't even know it existed till I saw that video.\nGive this game a try if you can overlook a few flaws, it can be quite the underrated treasure.", "hours": 63.9, "user_id": "76561198061710463", "username": "cooldragon1990", "products": 140, "early_access": false},

While both games have pop culture jokes, 3D's jokes are still memorable to this day while Forever is just too in your face about everything like the power armor is for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥joke. Speaking of power armor, Forever has regenerating health.  Let that sink in.\nOverall, Forever will never be as good as 3D, but that doesn't mean it's that bad.\nDuke is still funny with even more awesome one liners, a variety of things to interact with, decent graphics with a steady FPS, smooth controls and some fun levels to play in. Forever isn't a masterpiece like 3D but it's not a terrible game. It has a ton of flaws when compared to 3D, but it's better than any other modern FPS out there. It's just a decent game. Some might enjoy it, some won't. It's just a matter of preference. Just get 3D instead if you don't have it or if you do have it, just get Forever during a sale. Also, F*CK Gearbox for almost ruining Duke Nukem and Aliens.\nTL;DR: FOREVER IS A DECENT GAME.", "hours": 2.4, "username": "Sicko Mode", "products": 528, "early_access": false},

As you can see, it kind of had way more expectations that it should be, making people wait forever. While non-awesome spin-offs and even FPS Duke game on GBA were coming out.\nIt also came out for PS3 and Xbox 360. They are known for having technical troubles like framerate, some textures are always low-quality and long loading times. Also, didn't get patch which gives player an option to increase amount of weapons he can hold up to 4. Yea, PC is the way to go.\nShame that DLCs aren't available in Russia, maybe I am missing out on some good single-player stuff. Can judge only base game.\nMultiplayer community isn't dead, there are a few people playing it regulary. But you will only get Deathmatch and Team DM modes. Sadly, all of them seem to use infinite ammo mutators.\nAnd this game had a huge development history. In nutshell, one of the main people in 3D Realms wanted to make it the best game ever and so they would go and chase the goose of what was cool at current time, often going to change engine and having to remake stuff. All while they were throwing oil into fire of hype, screwing around publishers who really wanted them to just release something already, while giving no final product.\nThere are interesting trailers laying around. Like, the game started as a Half-Life clone set in some desert with female AI running around and even turret section that you all love. Then went into something with tentacle-infestation, though they say that a lot of stuff in 2001 trailer was made up for it. Then it went into more sci-fi-like stuff of clunkyness, then into more of Halo and such.\nJust don't tell me about \"looked ten times better\", I have enough experience to know that stuff always looks better in trailers than what it truly was. Not to mentioning that some stuff didn't look particulary interesting.\nAnd you know, that's the way development hell works: you don't spend time polishing and adding, instead you often remake core because you got better ideas all the time. And it just can go on forever when trying to reach perfection, especially during those times when technology was moving fast!\nIn the end, 3D Realms finally started to fall apart at \"so I heard Halo is cool\" iteration. In the end Gearbox, Piranha and Triptych (apparently fired DNF developers) ended up glueing and polising single-player part, adding multiplayer and spend 1-2 years doing legal mumbo and some stuff. And so they finally released at least something out of that embaressment. While also making people hate it because they had to fulfill all their \"once Duke Nukem Forever comes out\" joke promises. Now we have to do \"once Half-Life 3 comes out\", but it's not as fun because Valve promised nothing and don't even plan or tease anything.\nDammit 3D Realms, if not your stubborness we would have had an interesting Duke FPS franchise that would follow FPS genre evolution.\nAnyway, the plot of this game is that aliens came back, all while Duke was enjoying his infamousness, having saved Earth more than once. And it doesn't take long to find out that Aliens are here to wreck and and grow huge tentacles everywhere and to ruin Duke's little ego paradise.\nThe setting and Duke in this game is awesome. They didn't just take some generic game and slammed Duke's one-liners on top, aka Manhattan Project. They took what makes Duke game a Duke game and increased it by two times. Remember how people would give you example that in second level of Duke 3D you can shoot at ball on the billiard pool to make them roll around and that it somehow makes the game better than Doom (it doesn't)? Well, now it's an actualy playable mini-game winning which will increase your Ego (still doesn't make it better than Doom, STFU)! Actually, there are a lot of interactive fun stuff to do that increase your max Ego, what a wonderful idea for Duke 3D sequel.\nAll while going from the silly stuff like Duke's Vegas location, into the depressive The Hive, all while giving lots of variety and pacing. Platforming is nice, yes, don't tell me things. Shame that it's linear, more than say HL2.\nHeck, remember those maps for your favourite old FPS where you are a tiny being placed in a huge room of a house? Jumping on bed, hiding behind boxes, exploring mouseholes and such. Well, you now finally get to experience such thing in single-player campaign of Duke Nukem Forever! I think it's the first in single-player FPS games. Maybe.\nIt's a shame that toward the second half, when you go into Wild West thing and Dam, it deflates down. To be honest, Duke 3D deflated down fast as well, but not as hard. Not to mentioning that developers later released Atomic Edition which had awesome episode, being sorry for all non-awesomeness in base game. Then again, Forever got some \"Doctor Who Cloned Me\" DLC and people say that it's better too.\nNot as much fun interactive stuff. Not as much sillyness. And when you will be exploring dark generic corridors of the Dam you will be wondering if you are playing a proper Duke Nukem game or some kind of Duke It Out DC.\nAs for gameplay, Duke doesn't need any stinking syringes to eat out of medkits and is powered up by his allmighty and menly EGO alone. In other words, it follows some of the modern popular stuff, like here you have both regenerating Health and regenerating armor that is his Ego. Don't worry, monsters are now more vicious and you can't just camp behind a single barricade or anything because some can correctly teleport behind your back.\nYou also have only 2 slots for a weapon. Game is kinda designed around it, by trying to make you swap weapons by throwing lots of them and always giving RPG and ammo for bosses when you need, while each of them has low ammo. So stop it with always carrying RPG around. So it's not as tactical, but lets you relax and change around. You can also execute some enemies with melee punch or kick if they drop onto knees when almost ran out of health. Doing this will restore your Ego immeditly. Freezer weapon is actually balanced this way: it's not all that strong, but it gives 100% chance for execution to gain ego back during battle.\nAnd even then you can increase amount of slots to 4, but game was designed for 2, so I would recommend to stick to two.\nItems are more useful now too. Holoduke is now actually useful, as it also makes you invinsible to monsters. Steroids are now useful too since boosted melee can now 1-2 hit enemies. What was the point of these two in Duke 3D anyway? There is also beer that makes you take less damage and infinite dark vision where you can actually see environment too. Heck, pipe-bombs and laser-mines are now throwable by a hotkey, making them so much more comfortable and useful too. Awesome.\nI still miss more of mazey/sandbox feel of Duke3D levels, with all situations and angles you could get yourself into, but eh.\nThere are also more good bosses. And music is sadly your everyday orchestra, outside of multiplayer penthouse thing.\nThere is competetive multiplayer too. It's old-school in a sense that it's chaotic and not too enganging outside of that. Explosives seem to be more powerful than everything else, RPG is the top weapon. Laser-mines are everywhere and are hard to see unless you slow down. Pipe-bombs are too good too.\nIt also isn't so fancy technically, a lot of people experience lag. Also, no ragdolls, all Dukes always gib for some reason.\nThere is also leveling, but it only unlocks cosmetics for Duke and stuff in your penthouse. Which is fancy idea, though doesn't feel as good when ugly wooden boxes of \"yet to unlock\" stuff litter the house.\nEh, it's a pretty good game. Or at least fine for what it is. Or at least people can now move on from the Duke Nukem Forever development hell.", "hours": 20.1, "username": "Foxysen", "products": 1602, "early_access": false},

I had heard the game was terrible and, as I didn't want to ruin the nostalgia that I felt for Duke Nukem, I decided that I was going to avoid this title.  I was so, so wrong to judge this game before experiencing it first hand.\nThe game may not be perfect, but it is definitely fun.  I found it to be as enjoyable as any first person shooter that has been released in the last few years.  Duke is back in all of his glory and the gunplay is a blast.  His crude one-liners are more than welcome after the decade plus that I've waited for a worthy return and I found myself laughing frequently.\nThe mechanics of the game run flawlessly.  I didn't experience a single issue the entire time I played and the aiming and character controls are top notch.  Every single death and missed shot in the game felt like it was 100% my fault and not some aspect that was overlooked by the developer.  Another aspect of the game that I enjoyed was that, although the number of weapons to be found is about on par with the other games, all of the remained viable throughout the game.  They all have their pros and cons that you can use to your advantage for each situation that you find yourself in.  It also should be mentioned that, unlike the vast majority of FPS games out there, the game never felt monotonous to me.  One moment you'll be running and gunning, the next you'll be platforming after being shrunk down to the size of a can of soup, and the next you'll be manning a turret as hordes of alien ships and reinforments are en route to kill you.\nThere are two parts of Duke Nukem Forever that keep it from being an absolute gem, however.  First, is the restriction on the number of guns that you can carry.  Duke Nukem used to be a walking arsenal.  Every weapon that you found in the game you kept for the rest of your campaign and could use it at any time as long as you had the ammunition for it.  The second improvement to the game that could have made it a classic would be the vehicle controls.  Driving Duke's monster truck, while fun to run over aliens with, was a bit more of a hassle than I would have liked.  It wasn't absolutely terrible but it was enough that I was less than excited when I saw it ahead of me and knew that I would be driving instead of running and gunning which I would have preferred.  Fortunately, you don't spend very much time in it.\nI recommend this game to any first person shooter fans and especially to old Duke Nukem fans.  I had a blast and played it from start to finish in about ten hours over the course of four days.

Back in the 1990's my Mom would take me to the \"Crossroads Flea Market\", a dirty building full of merchants selling shoes, clothes, trinkets and videogames, shareware video games like Wolfenstien 3D, Commander Keen and Duke Nukem.\nSo my history with the Duke goes back a long way, I have great nostalgic memories of the awesome 2D platformer. Duke 2,  I played a bit of but not much. Duke 3D came out and I was enthralled. This was one of the first games that we played over LAN and set crazy pipe-bomb traps. I played Duke 3D again recently on my 360 and noticed how high the difficulty was and how obtuse some of the level design was. As a teenager Duke was the man, as a middle aged man Duke is terrible person.\nDuke Nukem Forever was something I followed since those first trailer appeared. After a decade, I admitted to myself that the game would never be released. Then it was announced, then released on PS3, 360 and PC. I was in disbelief. What kind of game did it look like? Well it looked like a single-player, linear, cheesy and throwback kind of game with crazy setpieces.\nNow I pre-ordered this game. Played it through on my 360, bought and finished the single-player expansion and came to a few conclusions:\nIf this game was released 10 years ago, it would be hailed as an awesome \"modern\" sequel to Duke Nukem 3D.\nIf this game was released as a \"budget\" throwback game, no one would complain.\nThe load times suck on consoles.\nLook, I am a middle aged man now. I have no problem sitting back and rolling through a single-player shooter in 8-10 hours  that is a bunch of stupid fun with some nostalgia thrown in (Dr. Proton!).

I have a few problem with it as well love a few things let's get the pros out of the way. I LOVE the shotgun feels good each time I shoot it I wish it actually blew enemies a part but oh well. I love the update to the pipe bombs Duke would totally put their Activation on his car keys I wish they didn't explode when they hit Enemies. most of the weapons feel good to use over all with a few expections. Writing is alright it has the same wit for the most part. Music has some great tunes in it. The game is about 15 hours long so that's good. Now for the cons I honestly wish they'd get patched. No Mighty Boot every weapon has a melee attack but I would prefer the Mighty Boot. I would also like to remove the Excute moves they happen rarely and aren't that fun to watch though the healing you get is nice though. The New Weapons kind of suck they lack punch only one I used is the what is basically a Scifi sniper rifle which is alright. the Ripper Feels weak and it seems as if the shooting is off for it. I'd like to weld ALL of Dukes Weapons and forget the Alien Weapons Completely including the rifle. Also I find the zoom pointless except for the Sniper Rifle and why is it attached to EVERYTHING from boosting the truck to the Pin ball machine Right bumber? shouldn't that be the melee attack? I wish Enemies just drop Ammo for Dukes Guns rather then their own guns. There's the hive scene that could have better lines like Duke \"♥♥♥♥ my Babes will they I'll make sure they pay\" Girls \"Duke saves us AGGGH\" Duke \"Ah Gross now they've done it time to Kick Alien♥♥♥♥♥and make sure they don't ♥♥♥♥ with anymore babes!\" or something along those lines. I wish the Secrets were better I'd enjoy some retro ones even like all of Hollywood Chaos at least outside of the Movie Theater and I'd like some Jetpack Usage in the Single Player. I also wish the gun fights happen more often at times there are some levels with Plenty of gun fights then ones where it seems to take forever to get to the next fight.

I myself was an avid fan of Duke Nukem 3D on the N64, and played it regularly with my brother anf friends for a long period of time. So, being familiar with Duke Nukem myself, I can say that my review will be based a little on my appreciation for Duke Nukem franchise, however I will try to be as unbiased as possible.\nDuke Nukem, having previously saved the world from the alien invasion, is now regarded as a celebrity and world superstar amongst the global population. The aliens once again attack the earth and steal the babes (only the hot ones) in search of revenge against their nemesis and planet earth. As a result, Duke Nukem goes back into action to save the world from the aliens once again.\nWith a really nice graphical update from its predecessor (this game has been in development for a\n), as well as Duke's classic inappropriate wit, I definitely enjoyed reliving the Duke Nukem experience. Some may say it goes a little over the top, however Duke's personality as well as those of other character such as Captain Dylan, make this a very comical FPS experience, with plenty of cheesy lines and film references to boot. Although a simple storyline (very typically Duke Nukem style), the FPS experience is still enjoyable, with classic weapons such as the shrink ray, expansion ray, trip mines, holo Duke etc. Ego boosts such as lifting weights, or shooting hoops can increase your ego (which acts as a health bar) as you progress through the campaign.

{"product_id": "57900", "page": 183, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-12-08", "text": "For better or worse, Duke Nukem Forever has all the qualities we now associate with modern FPS games.  Linear, corridor-like levels.  Recharging health.  Epic set pieces.  Vehicle sections.  The ability to carry only a few weapons.  Turrets.\nAs a huge fan of Duke Nukem 3D (I played through the original when it was released and still play through much of it yearly), I would be lying if I said DNF is a worthy successor to that DOS classic.  However, Duke 3D still works and we can always go back and play that whenever we want to.  The sad fact is, if you want to sell a FPS today you need to compete with COD, and that means playing by modern FPS rules.  A game like DUKE3D, with its large and sometimes mazelike levels and enemies that can tear through you in seconds, could not be released today by a major company.\nWhich is not to say that DNF gets a free pass for its faults.  The strict limit on the number of weapons you can carry means it very seldomly makes sense to take the risk of carrying some of the more unique weapons.  I played through the majority of the game with a pistol, shotgun, minigun, and rocket launcher, and while I wanted to play around with the freeze ray and shrink gun, they just seemed like suboptimal choices.\nThe vast majority of the game takes place in linear corridors, though this is sometimes broken up by larger areas you need to travel through in vehicles.  There is one section toward the end where you finally get our of a corridor and under water, but your oxygen is so limited that you basically have to follow a \"corridor\" of pipes letting out crucial air bubbles.\nThe corridor design works sometimes.  Toward the end there is a stage where you have to escape from a collapsing structure and even though it is totally linear and you cannot fail, it's pretty exciting the first time through.  The intro level is also pretty fun just because there is so much going on you forget you are travelling in a corridor.\nSadly, the middle sections (a good 1/3rd of the game) are extremely dull, and have you (literally now) running through corridors fighting the same 3-4 enemies, never in any real danger because of regenerating health and generous checkpoints.  Never mind the awful parts where Duke is shrunk down- this works nicely the first time it happens and you get to explore a \"giant\" kitchen, but the game repeats this trick another couple times and it gets dull quickly.\nThe weapons all feel pretty decent, though some of them (minigun especially) should have packed more punch.  There are also plenty of items to use.  They add some flavor to the game, but I was able to get through the game with no problem without using them at all.\nThe game looks surprisingly good with all settings turned up to max, especially considering how much review at the time complained about how dated it looks.  I ran it on a top of the line gaming laptop hooked up to a nice monitor, and it looked really decent.  Granted, much of the game takes place in a hallway.\nI didn't touch multiplayer.\nAs for the Duke stuff... as a fan of DUKE3D it was nice to see how a lot of stuff was updated for this, from the enemies, to the items and weapons, and the one-liners.  There is some really childish/lowbrown \"humor\" here that was totally absent from the classic game.  DUKE3D had some raunchy locations, but avoiding stooping to such low levels.  This stuff is few and far between though, and the Duke character is still charming.  Just like in DUKE3D he is a mixture of cool and lame, an action hero who doesn't realize that he is a little out of touch with the times, but at heart a decent guy who wants to save the world.  I especially like his final one-liner to the end boss, which is so ridiculous and over the top that you imagine he was trying to come up with the ultimate macho burn but instead came out with this crazy nonsense (though true to his word he does exactly what he promises).\nDuke Nukem Forever is not nearly as bad as its reputation would have it, and I certainly enjoyed the ~10 hours I put into it to completion.", "hours": 9.3, "user_id": "76561198020414098", "username": "newtmonkey", "products": 737, "early_access": false},

The three main points people bring up for why this game is worse than the holocaust are very easily countered and I honestly don't think can really be used as \"cons\" at all.\n1.  Duke Nukem is too sexist.\nThe fact that this complaint actually gains any traction whatsoever is really, REALLY stupid and it kind of pisses me off to some extent. Really? Duke Nukem being sexist? WHAT A HUGE SHOCK! That's the entire point, don't you guys remember? I could understand if you didn't find the jokes funny anymore, but that's not the devs' fault because they aren't any less mature than the ones in Duke Nukem 3D. If you didn't find the jokes funny then you simply grew up and don't find it funny anymore. Duke Nukem games aren't supposed to be some deep observation of the human spirit or the definition of heroics. Duke Nukem games are about guns, boobs and swearing. You get all three of those in this game, if you didn't like them here then you didn't like Duke Nukem 3D either.\n2. The graphics are terrible.\nUh, no, they really aren't, especially for 2011. It looks almost as good as Far Cry 2's max settings or even RAGE's high settings, just without DOF. This game looks REALLY good.\n3. It wasn't as groundbreaking as Duke Nukem 3D.\nSeriously, guys? Duke Nukem 3D wasn't very \"groundbreaking\" either. The engine it used had already been used to make Witchhaven and Powerslave (on the PSX and PC, not on the Saturn) and DN3D didn't do anything with the engine that those two games didn't. Another thing I'd like to point out is that Quake came out before this one did, and Quake is an actual fully 3D game, DN3D is still 2.5D. Hell, Marathon came out a full two years earlier and that game's engine stomps BUILD's testicles.\nWas it a disappointment? Yeah, of course it was. I was pretty disappointed with Half Life 2 because the violence was somewhat toned down and there weren't nearly as many weapons or enemies to fight. I felt like I waited too long for something that would have more in certain areas but way less in others. Disappointment does not mean horrible, though. Is Half Life 2 terrible? Not in the slightest. Is Duke Nukem Forever as good as Half Life 2? No, it isn't nearly as good. At the same time, though, Duke Nukem 3D isn't way more amazing than Doom 2 or Marathon or Quake or System Shock. All Duke Nukem 3D ever was was an interactive mid 90's action movie. Duke Nukem Forever is the exact same thing, except this one wasn't released in regular theaters and only got distributed through Grindhouse because there's quite a few♥♥♥♥♥♥here.\nI give Duke Nukem 3D 7.5 out of 10 and DNF 7 out of ten.

Women only appear in this game as sexual objects.  That's been a core part of Duke Nukem since at least 3D, but that doesn't make it OK.  And it ends up going past sexism and into misogyny.  Then you reach the Hive level and mix in body horror; it's disgusting in ways I don't think the developer intended.\nThat's too bad, because I really enjoyed the actual gameplay.  The basic shooting mechanic was a lot of fun.  I never got bored during the enemy encounters.  Some were really frustrating, but I was always able to get through by changing tactics.  It's full of great interactive bits like working air hockey and pinball games.  I was laughing so hard when I started drawing on a whiteboard and an NPC commented on it.  The later half of the game that was all about fighting aliens and making references to games and movies I like was great.  I wish they'd just done that.

And, just like the old games, each map could fit on an old 3.5\" diskette.  I mean, on the one hand you can rest easy knowing you're *never* very far from a checkpoint / level warp... but on the other, the maps are goddamn small.  It's like traveling the world... 10 goddamn feet at a time.\n- The game is old (4 years as of this writing), and plays even older.  Same stuff you heard at release - graphics are dated, engine is clunky, mechanics are simplistic.  For a Duke Nukem game, it's just fine.  For a \"game we waited 12 years for\", its an astounding disappointment.\n- It's short.  It took me 10 hours on \"standard difficulty\" to just plough through the whole thing, and that was with me wasting time to do stuipd sh!t like \"Win an air hockey game 7 - 0 at the strip club\".\n- The production values are rough.  The few cutscenes look like PS2 era graphics, or are literally \"flash animation\" type moving pictures.  After its done you can see that the \"Triptych Offices\" were an abandoned condo with a kitchenette and two chairs.  The game is an accurate reflection of what those kinds of resources get you.\nSo, why is this a positive review?  I enjoyed it.  As I said, I have no vested interest in the Duke Nukem franchise (trust me - I understand why they're upset), and I got the game for practically nothing.  As such, it's easy for me to simply not care about a lot of things.  If you're of a similar mindset, or can snag this during one of STEAM's sales (or both), I think it'd be worth your time / money.

The latter didn't work too well in DNF due to the power structure of the game's weapon set, though upping the carriable weapons to 4 in the game's option menu resolves any issues. The game featured lots of variety throwing in driving, platforming, turret & minigame sections, which were actually excelently placed, alternating nicely with the standard first person shooting gameplay sections so you never had too much of one thing at a time. Wolfenstein: The New Order notably had a problem with doing just that as the game threw non-combat after non-combat section at you in the middle portion of the game in a maybe 4:1 ratio with the first person shooting & bundled up all of the game's fps at the beginning & ends, so kudos to 3D Realms/Gearbox for getting that right.\nForever's FPS component is actually a lot of fun despite the regen health, limited weapon capacity & the slow movement speed. Shooting aliens is still shooting aliens, & DNF does it well.\nStory wise, it's whacky & expected. Basically the aliens from 3D come back to earth, attack & abduct all the women, & you, being Duke Nukem have to defeat them & save everyone. The writing frequently makes nostalgic references to not only DN3D but also other games from the time period like Doom & System Shock 2. The one liners are also enjoyable in the game, as always. One particular segment I liked was where Duke, shrunk to the size of an action figure navigates across a pantry shooting shrunk aliens.\nThe multiplayer is reminiscent of arena shooters. Despite having a 2 weapon limit in a set clearly not designed for such a thing, it also works quite well, the teamplay mode in particular\nfeature some cooperation between players using different weapons to their advantages.\nOverall, DNF isn't a work of art, no one really expected it to be, & it doesn't live up to 12 years of hype, or the awesome 2001 trailer, or its predecessor Duke Nukem 3D, but if you were to use one word to describe it, it would be fun. DNF is just that, a whole lot of whacky fun to be enjoyed for the right price.

Apogee Software was once a great MS-DOS Company that I miss so much, their once inovation of DOS Classics via BBS became a tragedy in all of Gaming History.\nIf this game was released back in 1998, Apogee Software would have continued proudly.

So, I agree with Gearbox: \"Duke Nukem Can't Die\". And so, thanks to Gearbox & 3D Realms, Duke Nukem is back from my MS-DOS Childhood Days to Next-Generation HD & he is here to stay!\nAnyway, Duke Nukem's got more One-Liners, Weapons and more Cool Features than You can ever ask for.

Yet this ♥♥♥♥♥ version needs to regenerate health, can't handle even 1 beer, and can only hold his breath for 10 seconds.\n*Lets start with regen health. It is ok, but I would feel better if I had my healthkit item to carry to repair my health at last minute, not hide around a corner and wait for my health to go back up. Kills most challenge for me.\n*The 1 beer thing is bull, come on.. even I can handle ONE beer.. I don't even drink. I get it is a power thing, but come on.. 1 beer, completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d.. Insane.\n*He can only hold his breath for 10 seconds (I just tried, I was fine for 40 seconds. Come on Duke, Nut up.).. which makes 1 bossfight annoying because you have to stop to fill up oxygen every few seconds, making that fight annoying.. Not even harder, just, annoyingly longer than it needs to be.\n*The other thing was the 2 gun limit. They DID fix it thank god with a option to let you equip up to 4 guns at once, but still, why should it be needed? Duke is the kind of man to kill everything, anyway he wants. Why even consider limiting your choices?\n*The bosses are only hurt by RPG and turrents?? Really? That alone I feel breaks what duke stood for. If I wanna punch a boss to death, let me. Don't limit my choices down, and take any creativity on how I beat the game away.\n*Finally, the nightvision.. oh my god.. can it be anymore blinding? Thank god you only need to use it like 2 - 3 times.. but damn, just bright blue and white everywhere. Terrible.. I would of rather a flashlight or even a darker green nightvision.\n_____________________________________________________________\nMy personal hatred is the graphics issues.

After 15 years of development hell the first true masterpiece in video games is here.\nThe game takes a lot of cues from modernist fiction. Much of the game is about topics such as sadness, loss, addiction, alcoholism, failure, family, mental health, morality, PTSD, fame, chaos, masculinity, spirituality and isolation. The structure of Duke Nukem Forever reinforces this and the entire game is split up into vignettes all structured like a recursive fractalic ionizing radiation symbol.\nThe game is set years after the first alien invasion and chronicles the post-war life of duke much in the same way the Greek dark age poem The Odyssey talks about Odysseus' struggle with post-war life and the hard transition for him. The game picks up shortly after the alien war. Duke has fallen on hard times, after an unsuccessful spout in politics, his failing business ventures leave him facing bankruptcy. The game switches then to 7 years later, duke is no longer remembered as the savior of earth and is forced into private life as a used car salesman married to a woman who doesn't love him and who is cheating on him. Duke falls into a deep depression and visions of his past haunt him at night, slowly the visions creep into the day and this vignette ends with a violent outburst in which duke believes the aliens have come back to earth.\nNow it's 3 years later, duke is an a mental facility dealing with the horrors of his past. His wife has left him and he struggles with a lot of health problems in this chapter. One of the patients in the facility recognizes duke but slowly over the course of the vignette the player realizes that the patient thinks that Duke is the great king Gilgamesh a champion of masculinity from the ancient near eastern epic poem.\nDuke next transition is into the desert, set only a year later duke is living on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Duke is forced into an emasculating job as a male prostitute who is forced to do disgusting acts for peanuts. Duke is slowly drinking himself to death in an attempt to kill the pain in his life. At several times during the course of this phase in his life he wanders drunk through the desert, in the last of this section Duke is lost in the desert for 40 days before reaching civilization and being tested with addiction by a strip club and gives into his desire. This section mirrors the temptation of Christ but twists the ending.\nThe next section takes place only 3 days later, Duke is an emasculated, mess of a man make impotent by the drink. Duke jumps off the Hoover Dam but fails and lands onto a child.\nDuke wakes up in a prison hospital missing his left leg. Duke has been sentenced to life without parole for drug possession and killing the child at the end of the of previous chapter. In the hospital the doctors discover Duke has prostate cancer from the steroids duke took during his youth. Duke loses all masculinity after his surgery and develops into a fat, sexless man confined to a wheelchair. Duke yet again falls into a deep pit of depression and wants to kill himself but just can't do it. It's implied that Duke is bottom to his cell partner. Duke dreams of the aliens from Duke Nukem 3D returning and him regaining his former glory and fame. Duke wakes up and starts crying, he reflects on his life and all the paths that brought him to his current state. Duke hangs himself in his prison cell.\nThis game is a truly bold move for the franchise and has entered gaming into a brave new world of creativity and story telling.", "hours": 13.8, "username": "Doritos Pope", "products": 384, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

They had the goose with the golden egg. A game so great nothing needed changed except to update those graphics and gameplay and technology improved. If only they would of realized it but instead they got stuck and an ugly track of making the next new and improved Duke Nukem. There were a few red flags on the way but THEY KNEW BETTER, not their fan base.\nThe problem with Duke Nukem 3-D, set aside the technology, was it is a PERFECT GAME. You can't improve prefection! Yes they could of improved level design and made new ways to interact with the enviroment but these were technological limitations. Technology as expanded a lot more since then.\nThe red flags. New and interesting hits were coming out with their own hard-core following. Namely third person shooter like Tomb Raider. Duke Nukem decided to up their game and follow that format... and made two bricks that surprisingly I enjoyed just the same just because I like Duke Nukem that much. But I know half of their base was miffed off enough to think twice about buying their next game. Duke Nukem Time to Kill and Duke Nukem Land of the Babes just don't click right with Duke. They took a pure FPS that was a reactive shooter and threw him into a 3PS where he controlled like a tank, moved like a tank and reflex got lost and the controls felt clumbersome. The only saving grace was his corny one linners and his semi-naked chicks peppered thought the levels. Duke was still Duke even though he drove like a tank.\nNow if the developers only took heed of those two flops. Nope. They messed up and still didn't reconize their winning formula which was the orignal FPS formula. They reconized the FPS part but were still trying to stay ahead of the curve and started ripping off aspects of other new hits. One of my ther favorite games but a bain to Duke... Halo.\nHalo wrote it's own rules and played it's own way and worked great, the game was designed around itself and was new and fresh and a different experience. Duke Nukem is not. Halo you accepted the rules as you played but the winning Duke rules are already set, his fan base expects them and are happy with the way he was in Duke Nukem 3-D.\nMajor mistake number #1\nDuke is his own man. He can carry around as many weapons as he wants. Chef or Chief even with his power suit can only carry two... wimp. That was the worst thing they did to Duke. He had an incredible selection of weapons with many creative ways to blow things up... suddenly he can only carry two weapons (four if you own the PC version)? I know they think they are forcing you to play smarter but there was a smart way to play Duke already... Always try to save your biggest guns because they are too easy to use and you really need them at the end of the game. The conclusions of Dukes fights were always hard on the final boss and you have better of saved your biggest gun.\nMajor mistake number #2\nEgo health. What the?!? Where's my health? What's this ego crap? Where's my armor? Health and armor are what built tension in Duke Nukem 3-D. Armor was always in limited supply so if you found all the armor on a level and needed more, you were out of luck. Health mostly to except if you broke a water supply, ugh, toliet, urinal, water fountain or fire hydrant. But healing from those literally took minutes and another fifteen second fight later you might be almost dead again. Tension Builder. Duke's ego health threw all that out the window. Ego is your shield, take a hit and ego goes down. Wait a little while without taking a hit and it recharges just like Halo's shield. Ego get depleted and you invisible health bar goes down showing you by how red the screen gets between hits and your health bar is three to four hits period. This turns our manly Duke a more effective chicken. Retreat until ego comes back and try again. Never thought I'd head Duke cluck.\nFinal mistake number #3\nHalf of Duke's cool gadgets! Yes half of them seemed silly but they all had points in the game where you really needed them! My personal favorite was the mobile health pack. You always had an extra 100 health points but you never really want to use it if you think you can find health and save it for a boss battle. Night Goggles, useless thoughout 9/10ths of the game except for those black rooms. Jet Pack, about a minute of flying without worrying of falling down difficult jumps. Protective Boots you didn't need to worry about acid or lava while they held out. This is only the list that got dropped though they did add a new one... beer. One can of beer and a drunk Duke could take twice as much damage before his ego went dry.\nUnfortunally Duke Nukem Forever got glammered by Halo and the two formulas will never work well together. Hopefully the next game will be call Duke Nukem Returns Baby! as in a return to the formula that made him great and still has a lot of punch left even this late in the game and so many dissapointed Duke Nukemers.\nRecommend this game? This one is so close to the line. I loved this series so much I can't let it go with flaws and all and am sorely dissapointed with a lot of it. I also can imagine un-installing it either. If you are a hard-core Dukem fan, yes. If not... no.

OK but it certainly does not live up to the genius of its predecessor.\nIt is an extremely linear game and as a result severely lacking in replay value. There are almost no true decisions to be made in this game. It almost plays itself. For that reason (and due to the relatively simple controls) this would be a good game to play if you had never played an FPS before and wanted to learn (but UT2004, a very different kind of FPS, is even better for this). The game has good graphics (in a style sort of half-way between Doom 3, Prey and Half Life 2) with an engine that seems closest to Prey's graphical engine. There are moments of irritation in this game and moments of greatness (the monster truck travel section was great). This game however loses itself in its focus on Duke Nukem's personality rather than on the potential of its various environments (In Duke Nukem 3D it was the amazing environments and complex level design that were the actual focus. In that game Duke seemed to merely be there along for the ride in many ways). Overall, Duke Nukem Forever is less intelligent than its predecessor and feels like a game paying homage to its predecessor (and it largely fails to be satirical). Parts of the game often remind me (perhaps this was done intentionally) of a few other games; mostly Doom 3, Half Life, Prey, Revolt and even, occassionally, bioshock. The jokes made in the game often feel stale or fall flat and Duke's personality (and the game's focus on his personality instead of on the potential mysteries of the aliens he's fighting or the possibilities of his environment) is even irritating at times. The game is often exciting (at least the first time through) with some parts reminding me of parts of the Alien and Aliens movie/game franchise (good but possibly derivative). The Steam version of the game I played ran wonderfully and had very few bugs...but with such an extremely linear game (no branching side-paths, no alternate endings, etc.) there's not much here to be buggy. Somehow this game was at once exciting...and\ndifferent ways. The sexism in this game was no worse I think than that found in Duke Nukem 3D..but it would have been nice (even predictable for the modern social climate) if the game had an equal/opposite female heroin that Duke could \"interact\" with from time to time (like an ex-girlfriend or something), but alas no. Duke Nukem's personality alone does not provide enough interest for a game to focus on in such an exclusive manner...the result was somewhat irritating.", "hours": 13.6, "user_id": "76561198075673573", "username": "wrygrass", "products": 450, "early_access": false},

An unrelenting rampage of gunfire, one-liners, dismemberments, eviscerations and urinating on your foe's cerebral cortex. Nothing quite like it. Except that I wouldn't bet on it.\nThe thing about Duke Nukem is that you're looking for that 90s feel of a game. Where you shoot before asking questions and where cover if for the weak. You go, face first into the fray, killing and disrespecting the invaders of earth as you brutally reduce them to porkchops. Which makes it so weird that\nholds you back for what seems to be a large portion of the rather short game. The first hour is spent toying with lewd buttons, curling dumbells and drawing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on whiteboards. The following shooting section is to brief to qualify for a jump in adrenaline and all the subsequent shootouts are few and far between.\nI mean, think about it; You're Duke Nukem, the blueprint of masculinity. Any blogger from Tumblr would cry in irreversible horror at the binary gender appropriation this man radiates. Yet the game makes you look and play like what Arnold \"The Governator\" Schwarzengger would refer to as \"a girly man.\" You are weak; you can't take a lot of punishment, and when you add up the score you don't really murder that many aliens. It gets worse. As the game progresses, you're sent into more and awkward set piece stages that have no place in a testosterone fueled shooter. It even sends you to fight a boss underwater. Something the game wasn't calculated to handle as the swimming controls are set in stone and you're even weaker than before.\ndoes have its moments. Usually in the form of banal comedy or the sudden change up where you're shrunk to seven inches and you have to ride an RC car through a hotel while dodging kitchen appliances. At times you'll have fun with the physics engine while playing a game of pool or you spend a good few minutes listening to Duke's baritone giggles as he slaps a set of mammaries that are attached to wall (true story). However,\nis lacking in so many areas, and in particular the design and refinement that you'll be glad when it's over.", "hours": 9.9, "username": "Whoota", "products": 363, "found_funny": 7, "early_access": false},

It wasn't what most people expected. But I assure you most of these people are C.O.D fanboys that expected a serious, realistic game. No, this is a unique experience in it's own gener of gaming, fun. You may not have the same level of humor as me but the jokes and one liners Duke makes give me a smile and a laugh.\nSINGLE PLAYER- Overall this game takes after the years of Duke but the aliens have come back for revenge. I'll admit, some of the gameplay controls do feel sloppy at first when you start but I mostly have no problem what so ever taking out the bad guys. People conplain about the gameplay mecanics like driving and shooting but this is the case of either the player or the game itself that is doing something wrong, for me it's the player, nothing wrong with the game. Throughout levels you'll come across the small, interactable things witch make it more entertaining just to play and if you're searching for acheivements then you'll get them pretty esay as you play. You may die a few time to faults made by mistakes that can frustrate people, depending on your PC build the loading time will get annoying.\nMULTIPLAYER- The multiplayer takes the exact same elements from single player to this. Same gunplay and controls but is still fun to customise your own Duke in a few variety of ways. What makes multiplayer worth playing is the unlockables to use in \"Your Digs\". This is Duke apartment, when you first enter everything will be in storage crates and you need to be a certian level in the game to unlock. From different interactable props to unlockable babes makes the place more lively and more enjoyable.\nLag can be a problem for me and many other players but is capable to get used to. As long as you shoot someone when your crosshair is red then you'll always hit them.\nCONCLUSION- Nukem has aged ever since his retro years but is still very enjoyable. I personally give this a rating of 7/10. I first got this on Xbox 360 when it first came out and wasn't disappointed and got it again on Steam when it went on sale, so if you're sceptical about this game, best to wait for a sale to come across.\nRECOMMENDED TO- People who want to enjoy a laid back game and want to have a good laugh. Those who'd like to relive Duke.\nUNRECOMMENDED TO- Hardcore type gamers who are compedtitive, proberbly to those who get frustrated easily to.\nYes...

I picked this one up really late because honestly I avoided it a lot, and after all this time, after the dust has settled, lets just see how this game truly is.\nFirst of all, prior to writing this review I decided to investigate a bit in the 15 years it took this game to be developed and the whopping 20-30 milion dollars invested in this (Wikipedia source: While the game neared completion, the funding began to dry up. Having spent more than $20 million of their own money, Broussard and Miller asked Take-Two for $6 million to complete the game. According to Broussard and Miller, Take-Two initially agreed, but then only offered $2.5 million. Take-Two maintained that they offered $2.5 million up front and another $2.5 million on completion. Broussard rejected the counteroffer, and on May 6, 2009, suspended all development.\")\nHoly♥♥♥♥♥♥ All that money, all that hype, all the promise, all those expectations....all for nothing.\nDuke Nukem Forever starts things off fairly sily, with the endgame boss battle from D3D recreated here, the game starts you off in your penthouse doing...nothing. It starts out guns blazing, fighting the Cycloid Emperor, but then things start to slow down, drasticaly. Why? Wtf. Also, the first joke in the game, literally the first line of the game is the only funny one \"After twelve ♥♥♥♥ing years it better be good\". They knew they ♥♥♥♥ed up. They ♥♥♥♥ed up so royaly they could never, ever live up to the hype and expectations. Especially with a game that looks and plays like this. This is the main problem, this is what SUCKS. You start the game, walking like a jackass, looking at backgrounds that look so ♥♥♥♥ing horrible, even the 2001 demo had a better looking Las Vegas, you wait for people to move out of the way, listen through boring dialogue, you walk, you walk, you wait for the President to talk to you about some♥♥♥♥♥♥that you don't care anyway, you punch a few aliens and FINALLY you get a gun. Wow, talk about a slow start, about 30-40 minutes without any action. And after the \"action\" kick in, you realize something. Hey, wait a minute, why do the guns feel so lame? Why don't enemies react better to my shots? Why is there such a low ammo cap? Why am I regenerating health? Why is there NO GOOD MUSIC IN THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME? AND WHY IN THE HOLY MOTHER OF ♥♥♥♥ AM I DOING PLATFORMING AND DRIVING SEQUENCES IN A ♥♥♥♥ING DUKE NUKEM GAME? No, there is no excuse for this mess. No wonder 3D Realms collapsed after this, they invested 20 milion dollars in a game that was announced in 1997, 1998, 2001, 2007 and released in 2011. They♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on their fans. \"When it's done\" ♥♥♥♥ you, seriously, worst thing about this whole fiasco is that Duke Nukem is probably DEAD FOREVER. This may have been the final nail in the coffin.

It's just not worth it, I had to try it out for myself to see exactly all it's flaws, but man, does it suck big time. No reedeming factors here. I was expecting a bit more fan service to say the least, but nope. It's just a linear, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, corridor shooter that makes fun of other \"modern games\" but plays exactly like one.

I loved the originals, even replayed them on win7 with some 3rd party tools. Despite how much I liked the originals, this game is terrible. It's so bad that I will not buy another game by Gearbox.\nI played the original games when DN first came out.  Duke Nukem Forever is a crappy imitation, with slightly better graphics. I say slightly better graphics because most of the game is too dark, and using Duke Vision of course, takes out the color. I'd bet they made it too dark so we WOULD use duke vision, thereby removing the need to colorize. It's not funny enough, more importantly it JUST ISNT FUN.  Too many stupid stupid puzzles wasting time, and NOT ENOUGH GIBBING!. Every short level seems to have 3 or 4 stupid stupid puzzles to solve before one can proceed.\nThe interaction with in-game items is clunky. Running/jumping is awkward. Even something as simple as auto-stomping shrunken enemies is inconsistent. I hit two pig cops with the shrink ray and ran over, around , and back and forth and the auto-stomp didnt work (it did work on the first two I tried). OH, and there's also way too much time spent shrunk. In one area we have to jump from one box across to another box. Due to the shortcomings of the way the character runs/jumps, I wasted 20 minutes trying to get across. Each time I fell, I would have to climb boxes on one side of the rack, run across to the other side of the rack, climb more boxes, AGAIN run across to the other side of the rack, then try to jump and fall, only to repeat the pointless exercise again. I finally noticed, on the far side of the opposite rack, the back corner had a different texture so we could climb it. Immediately after that room there was yet another stupid puzzle that involved mini-duke running and jumping and trying to not get electrocuted.  Again, they got too cute with all of the STUPID STUPID puzzles.\nAlso there are new weapon restrictions. One of my favorite weapons, the rocket launcher, is limited to 5 rounds total. Additional problems: too restricted in game-play. Most of it so far is clear one small area with only one path to proceed, move on to the next small area with a very limited set of options.\nIt's like 3-D arcade play. Or playing a game in a long twisting turning hallway that's painted with different scenes.  And in keeping with the arcade/console gameplay, the ability to manually save a game has been removed. Yes, they've now added checkpoints, so saves happen at random intervals and we can't save before we try to do something jumping across a gap in one of the stupid stupid puzzles.\nOne other asinine \"feature\". I guess ol' Duke hasn't been keeping in shape. If you run, he starts panting LOUDLY after about 3 seconds. Not so macho, I guess...\nThe whole purpose of a game is to have fun. If you want to play this while getting a root canal to distract you from the pain, AND the game is less than $1, I'd say go for it. If you want to buy the game to play for fun, don't buy it, unless you actually like things like root canals, meaning you're a masochist.\nNOTE: The DLC game was MUCH more enjoyable than the main game.

It's not nearly as bad as reviews had said when it was first released. However, DNF does drag on alot, and is quite mediocre at times. The politically incorrect humor and the Arnold Shwarz. badassness was enough to keep me entertained.\nThe Pros:\n- Duke's personality is funny in a politically incorrect way. He might offend alot of people, but not me.\n- You can interact with alot of the environments, mostly for the sake of comedy.\n- The game ran very smooth\n- Gunplay is satisfying\n- Surprisingly diverce gameplay.

I find the DUkes presence in videogames quite refreshing, and I think the voice actor was pretty spot on for the type of character Duke was.

I cannot understand the negative reviews. This is 2011, not 1995 ladies and gentlemen! The graphics are beyond outstanding, and make great use of the eye candy on an nVidia 750 graphics card or better.\nI have this game running through my Samsung soundbar with subwoofer connected to the toslink optical digital output of my motherboard, and every sound and explosion is exciting. I love the driving parts, as this adds a new touch. A game cannot always stay the same. It has to progress and add things to make it new and refreshing, while keeping it old school with the Duke voice and trash talk.\nBy the way, to those that say there is bashing of women or women trashing, let me remind you,  this is not so different from the first game, but they just add more you can get away with today. And actually, Duke loves his women :) It's an ADULTERATED game, meaning not made for kids, although I know kids are going to get it anyways. It's not going to be a rated G game, so to say it's women trashing or has dirty language does not change the fact this is the character of Duke Nukem.\nYou can't say a game is bad because of what the authors chose to put in it when the gameplay, sound and graphics are so awesome beyond that! I am not saying I am going to talk to women like that or say all that bad language, but this is to be expected of the character and attitude of Duke Nukem!\nThe gameplay, graphics and sound is awesome. To some who said they had freezing or something like that, I can assure you it is NOT the game doing that. Check your computer, make sure you are using a next generation processor, motherboard and graphics card with all hardware and software drivers up to date.

Sure, it's no masterpiece by any standard and not even remotely close to being an exceptional game, but at the end of the day I had a lot of fun playing through it.\nThe levels are really great and possibly one of the best features of this game. During the story, you get to see tons of environments. Unfortunately, not all developers do that anymore today. In today's games, you often get just one scenario and then they stick with that during the entire game. Not so in this game. You get a Casino, Las Vegas, the Canyon, some Burger-tower (which is kind of cool), a construction site, some alien world, and tons more.\nThe weapons are mediocre to me. Sure, you get \"The Ripper\" and the RPG, but all in all the weapons are nothing worth mentioning. As a fan of Duke 3D, that's disappointing.\nThe voice of Duke is really awesome. Like it's really great, as it has always been. I agree that the one-liners and what Duke is saying is really 80's-like, cheesy and macho, but anyone being surprised by that clearly has never played any of the Duke games ;) It's sad that so few of today's heroes lack a personality. In this game, Duke still got his. And that's really great!\nThe difficulty is a strange one. To me, the game feels kind of unevenly paced at times. Some parts I had to re-play more often than necessary (the first boss fight for example), while others were too easy. The pig \"cops\" are also extremely annoying in this game and jump around on speed. I liked the pig cops from Duke 3D way more.\nAlso what I think harms this game more are all these \"\"modern\"\" (yes, double quotes) elements like the weapon carrying limit (what the hell is the point of that anyway??) and the self-healing (why are medkits so taboo nowadays??). They should have left these elements like they were in Duke 3D. Nobody gives a damn anyway. And here the criticisms are most definitely justified. They should have left all \"old-school\" elements in there. It would have made the game better. Instead, there's an \"old-school\" component and a pretentious \"modern\" component. Apparently they tried to cater to all those Halo or CoD-players that don't know games without self-healing existed. It doesn't work.\nIn the end, it's by no means a bad game.

I suppose it was their undying love and fond memories for the Duke Nukem of the 90's, but still, how good could this game have been when it was passed around more times than some lame joke about a girl who is very promiscuous? Actually...pretty damn good, if you ask me!\nThis game was destined to fail ever since year five in development, so it really doesn't matter now, but like I said, if you were a fan of the original 'Duke 3D' game, then this game should be pretty enjoyable for you. Or maybe it won't be, who cares, either way get f'd and buy it cheap. But still, 'Forever' manages to be more imaginative than 75% of new shooters out there today and maintains some of the humor and feel of gameplay from the original. The storyline is the same 'save the world from the aliens' but what else did you expect, and each map feels fresh and fun to play through each and every time, with small puzzles and challenges along the way.\nOverall, this is a game most people have most likely already forgotten about, but it's still incredibly fun if you ask me. And even though it's probably not the game that the developers originally set out to make, I'm still thankful to have been able to play this version. So pick this one up for a few bucks during the next sale if you're a fan of Duke Nukem or shooters in general.

Other games seem to pull off head bobbing fine, but this like Duke is taking really high, short steps.\nThe graphics are also puke.  It looks like a very early Xbox 360 game with low res textures and polygons and recycled objects that make the levels seem barren (even for a desert) and uninspired.\nThe game is also short, but somehow it just seemed to draaaag on and on.\nThe only way to recommend this game is if you want to see how bad this game really is and it's on sale for under $5, or if you are some teenie-bopper noob.\nLong-time Duke Nukem fans should definitely stay away, as this game will prove how this game should have never been released.", "hours": 11.1, "user_id": "76561197966108129", "username": "offensive_jerk", "products": 852, "early_access": false},
{"product_id": "57900", "page": 220, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-02-13", "text": ", probably one of the most anticipated and hyped up games of all time, but did it live up to the expectations of Duke Nukem fans? Not exactly. Does that mean\nis a bad game?\nUnfortunately,\nwas not very well received by critics and fans when it was eventually released in 2011 after\n. The most popular places to read PC Gaming reviews all shunned\nshortly after it's official release and it was deemed as the worst game in the series. Despite all of the negativity and bad reviews surrounding the game, I decided that I would try it myself to see whether or not it is as bad as everybody makes it out to be... After playing it through a good number of times, I do not think this is a bad game at all, in fact, I truly believe that this is a game worthy of the\ntitle, even though I seem to be very alone with that opinion. I believe that this is a really great game, flawed mainly by it's release date, if it was released back in 2004, it would have been considered a much better game as it doesn't really meet todays standards.\nSure, it's not the most phenomenal game ever released, nor is it revolutionary like\nor\nwere, but it's not a bad game either. When it is looked to as the \"successor\" to\n, the game will naturally be compared to it's originals, but if you look past that,\nis a good game within it's own right.\nIt's lengthy, fast-paced and very interactive single-player campaign is an example of what modern games should be looking to set as their goals, it's very, very rare you will find any singleplayer games with any more than 8 hours of singleplayer game-play in this day and age, so that is a big bonus. The game is also very atmospheric, comedic and  varied, you can tell this game has come from an era from the past, though unfortunately many years too late.\nAll of your favourite weapons from\nmake a return, so there is no problem there, excluding the fact that you are limited to how many you can carry now (more about that below), there are a few more new weapons to play with such as the Railgun and the Enforcer Cannon which are both satisfying to use, there are a few more but nothing glorious.\nGraphically, the game isn't exactly groundbreaking but it's still a very pretty and well-made game, you can tell that a lot of work has gone into it. The humour is the same as it's always been, cheesy and crude, but funny (most of the time). There are also endless references and easter eggs that you will come across throughout the campaign that are bound to amuse you.\nThe game has it's flaws, as most of you will already be aware because the critics love letting you know about it, but there are only two things that spoil this game for me. The first issue is that some of the maps feel linear and relatively simple, especially when compared to\n... General exploration is limited and there are little to no secrets to discover in the game, which is a shame given how much fun it was to explore in\n, but health bonuses are non-existent anyway now so finding a secret area may not be as great as it once was.\nSecondly, the two weapon limit is frustrating and can ruin the experience more often than not, there is an option to enable a four weapon limit as opposed to the two, but this is still an issue, the reason being is that some weapons are mandatory to destroying certain enemies, with a limited inventory, you are constantly made to pick and chose between the weapons you want on the spot rather than keeping everything at once like you could before. This ultimately damages the singleplayer quite a lot, it also makes exploration and any secrets feel a bit pointless as ammunition and hidden weapons are now more of a burdening choice than they are a bonus.\nSo, flaws aside, I will stand by and defend\nby saying that it is a good game. Rather than avoiding it based on what most critics had to say, you should ultimately decide for yourself if you like it or not after playing it through, I know lots and lots of people are on a bandwagon preaching hate to the game when they haven't even given it a chance, and that's just lame. Rather than paying full price, I do recommend buying the complete set (DNF & DLC) during a sale. Don't believe everything you hear, try things for yourself before you make assumptions.\nThis game is not as bad as people make it out to be.", "hours": 48.3, "username": "-Aro-", "products": 607, "early_access": false},

So you end up gunning down aliens mostly with the triple cannon machinegun.\nThe story is purely decorative and the characters flat as a carpet. Half of the time the soldiers are coward and stupid, but that does not make Duke intelligent or brave.\nIt could have been a decent shooter but the game is blatantly sexist. Of course it comes with the character, but as far as I remember, all the female characters are either : horny at the mere sight of the Duke, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ providers, incapable of saving themselves, sex workers, alien surrogate mothers begging you to shoot them. I don't recall any female soldiers, scientists or civilians worth noticing. The developers pushed the envelope up to the following point : aliens are only abducting women, so you have to save them!\nIs there an irony here? Maybe aliens are in fact abducting women to protect from the Duke? That would have been a hell of a twist!\nSo if you're confortable with that level of sexism, Duke Nukem Forever deserved a 6/7 as a shooter.

I like cars, and sometimes when you buy a used car, especially that was someone elsee's project, not everything's all there. Sometimes the back seats are missing because the previous owner wanted less weight, sometimes the dashboard is cracked from years in the sun, sometimes there are just problems that don't need to be there.\nDuke Nukem Forever is a used project car that you can't finish. You can see the tape on the wiring, you can see where parts were spliced into it, It's a mess.\nFirst off, enemies are bullet sponges. This was a problem in DN3D, but not at this level. Good news is that headshots do seem to work on some enemies, and they do an entertaining cartwheel ragdoll. Some enemies like the floating fat guys and the octobrains are given way too much significance and are almost boss battles.\nThe game offeres a few  modern FPS no-nos, like limited weapons, limited enemy count, Regenerating health, Corridor levels, it's really sad to see these anti-fun measures applied to duke.\nThe game's humor is pretty good, Some pop-culture references fall a little flat in this age of the internet, but they're really no better or worse than classic OJ Simpson trial references found in Duke3D. The DLC campaign is another story though. The humor is god awful, and they even try and work some social justice into it, but with anthony burch writing for the game, Just like his wife by other men, it's going to get messed with. in particular there's a part where you're supposed to reject a \"slap-a-hoe\" arcade machine, then the game celebrates you NOT playing it. Why was it even put in in the first place? There's no reason for it to exist.\nWhich brings me to another point. Much like classic dook, there are tons of interactables in the environment. Sadly, these are often more fun than the rest of the game. Duke Nukem was never an original game. It was always a pop-culture spouting rip-off game. Duke 1+2 were contra/metroid rip-offs, Duke 3 was a doom/ROTT clone. This duke you can trell when it tries to emulate first HL2, then Halo, then CoDMW respectively. And the problem with emulating 3 games is, it doesn't know what it wants to do. Duke 3D took the platform of Doom and made its own adventure. These newer ones don't stray a terrible lot and are really bland.\nThis game DOES have multiplayer, the multiplayer IS dead, but when it was alive, it was absolutly fantastic. It was fun, Fast paced, challenging, and had a ton of unlocks that don't really affect gameplay, but unlocked activities for you to do in your hotel room, like pool, or darts or pinball. So there's no one who slogged it out and got the super ultimate gun and beginners are scared off. But, the MP is dead so it's a moot point.\nOn it's own, if this game was called Mr. shooter guy, had NO ties to duke nukem, this would be a forgettable, mediocre game. But this game was a sequel to one of the best games of the 90's. This game is an insult. It's a tragedy that this will be Duke's last adventure. This COULD have inspired a whole new generation to love dook with his witty humor and great gameplay, but instead it's a lazy hodge podge hastily thrown together from years of most likely rejected content.", "hours": 3.8, "user_id": "76561198011984060", "username": "Todd Powered", "products": 284, "early_access": false},

As Duke says himself near the beginning of the game “after 12 ♥♥♥♥ing years, it better be (good).” Sadly, the game was thoroughly mediocre and nobody was impressed. Strangely, DNF has a 55 metacritic rating which is rare for a big name game but the Steam player reviews for the game are “mostly positive.” I’d guess that’s because no matter how disappointing the game is, it still isn’t “horrible.”\nIt’s been so long since I played the old DOS game Duke Nukem 3D (Or Duke Nukem 1 & 2 before that) so I can’t really recap it. Fortunately, you don’t need to have played to older games to get what’s going on in DNF. An alien fleet is looming over the Earth and the US president is confident that peace negotiations are going well. It’s a good chance these are the same aliens from the previous Duke Nukem games so the president is worried that our hero Duke is going to pick a fight and start a war. Naturally, the aliens attack (and start stealing Earth’s hot women) so it’s up to Duke Nukem to kick their asses once again.\nGameplay for Duke Nukem Forever is straightforward first person shooter with no real innovations, except a few places in the game where you get shrunk down to the size of a Barbie doll and need to navigate terrain puzzles while avoiding the huge (normal size) aliens. The puzzles in the game are not too difficult to figure out, which is a good thing because DNF doesn’t have a “hint” system (where you hit a button and it shows you where you’re supposed to go next). Usually the door you’re supposed to go through has an orange flash, but it is still possible in a few places not to know what to do next (like one level in particular involving a crane wrecking ball).\nWhen I first played through the game about a year ago, one of the gripes I had was the limited weapon inventory. For a first person shooter there’s actually an adequate variety of guns to choose from, both human and alien (pistol, shotgun, machinegun, rocket launcher, etc.) The problem was that you could only carry 2 weapons at a time like in Halo 1.  When you run out of ammo, you can drop the gun you’re holding and pick one up from a fallen enemy. This would have been fine except that one of the game’s Steam achievements requires you to carry the pistol for the entire game, leaving you with 1 other weapon. I believe the developers patched it though, so now you can carry 4 weapons at any given time. The game’s health system is the now standard regenerating life system except that instead of being called health, it’s called ego. You can raise your maximum ego by doing various environmental things like looking a porno magazines or lifting weights that you find lying around on various levels. Most of your ego boosts will probably come from killing bosses though.\nPros:\n+Fights with giant alien bosses are always a plus in my book. Unfortunately, only a couple of these fights involve outside the box thinking. For example the giant alien queen requires pipe bombs and dodging alien impregnators. Most boss fights just require spamming rockets and circle strafing. All bosses can only be hurt by turrets and explosive weapons.\n+Decent variety in enemies and environments. The game’s graphics aren’t bad when it comes to the grotesque alien enemies that you’re facing. You get an up close look at a few of the melee enemies. I wasn’t a big fan of the alien hive level because of the weird night vision system that the game uses (Duke Vision) but at least  it changes things up a bit. The underwater level was kind of fun where you need to swim from air supply to air supply.\nCons:\n-Outdated humor. The game makers tried to keep the feel of the old Duke Nukem games by having Duke constantly spit out one liners and other macho stuff. The problem is that he seems to say something every time you kill an enemy so some of the quotes keep repeating over and over (“Wonder how many pork chops I can make out of you” after killing a pig alien which is one of the most common enemies in the game). Since you’re killing aliens every few seconds a ton of the quotes are heard about a hundred times by the end of the game. Have you seen the Expendables movies with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger? You know how all the old washed up action heroes keep using quotes from their successful movies? The DNF humor feels kind of like that.\n-The game just doesn’t stand out in any way. If this wasn’t supposed to be the glorious return of Duke Nukem, the game wouldn’t have been such a disappointment. People would have just said, “meh nothing special about the game. Play it and forget it.” But of course the fans seem to feel like the 12 years since the previous game should have been spent perfecting Duke Nukem Forever.\nA friend was using the Steam family sharing thing to play DNF off of my account and I asked why of all the available games he would be playing a game so mediocre. He said it was because he hadn’t tried it but had played the previous Duke Nukem games. I guess it’s like the Aliens vs. Predator movie franchise. Everyone seems to think the movies suck, but I like Aliens and I like Predators, so might as well see the movie once. Make sure that you don’t pay too much for the game though (less than $5). As for the game’s DLC “The Doctor Who Cloned Me,” the DLC is actually pretty long (about 5 hours I think) and doesn’t really add much new to the experience. I think there’re only a couple new weapons, but there are a few new bosses to fight.", "hours": 22.8, "username": "widgetguy", "products": 1622, "early_access": false},

You can't expect it to seem good to you if you're expecting something serious.\nWhile I wasn't a fan of the Duke Nukem games before, because I was born a bit too late and I missed the \"Golden Era of DOS Games\", I became a fan now. I had finished the game once before, when it just hit the market, but I wasn't very impressed, mostly because of the reason mentioned earlier.\nHowever, the game grew on me, and I decided to buy it for myself and finish it on the hardest difficulty - which I'm currently working on.\nI always choose to play 3D shooters on the hardest difficulty because the harsh challenge makes the game extremely fun, and the more difficult it is to finish the game, the more rewarding the feeling you get when you finally manage to do it. Besides, even when played on \"Come Get Some\", the game seemed pretty easy to me, most of the time. The real challenge comes when you're able to play it on Insane. A piece of advice: arm yourself with a very good weapon besides the rocket launcher or the devastator when you're going to fight the Octaking. It is by far the most difficult boss battle in the entire game.\nSo, why didn't I like the game when I first played it? Well, like I said, it had to do with the overall immature style of it, but I wasn't aware it was supposed to be immature. If that was also your first impression, give it another chance and play it on a hard difficulty. Trust me, you'll love it! Played like that it's an old school shooter at its finest.\nOh, and by the way, I think the shrink ray is actually trying to make another reference - like many others you will find during your playthrough, and it's intentionally made to look like something right out of Portal.

Why? This isn't Halo or Cawadoody. This is supposed to be a revival of a classic action game wherte you're a walking armory! Still, even that choice might be something I could tolerate.

Face-palming ensues.\nThe Good:\n+ They nailed Duke's persona spot-on\n+ Jon St. John is back voicing Duke\n+ The \"go mess around\" levels are sometimes funny\n+ The gratuitous T & A fit Duke perfectly\nThe Bad:\n- puzzles\n- platforming\n- driving\n- the fact that the above 3 are even in a Duke 3D game\n- the \"go mess around\" levels got old fast (slow-paced & no action)\n- unintuitive maps, puzzles, etc (\"where do I go?\", \"what do I do?\")\n- short oxygen meter & forced situations using it (cheap deaths)\n- short action sequences that force you into killzones (cheap deaths again)\n- short action sequences that are a joke (infinite ammo and rocket launchers)\n- action / gun-fights in general are treated like side dishes instead of main course (argh)\n- DLC has more of the same, but replaces Duke with another person doing all the trash-talking (!)\nBefore I get started, the Duke of old, 2D platforming days is gone. When they released Duke Nukem 3D they totally rewrote who and what Duke was. THAT is the Duke that this game was meant for. However, I suppose for nostalgia's sake, they decided to push him back into a 3D version of his old 2D game world.\nIt doesn't work.\nWhen you think \"Duke\" from Duke 3D days you think action. So, what should have been a straight-forward run-n-gun (a la Serious Sam) was instead developed as a puzzle / platformer / driving / mini-game / turret-shooter with action elements thrown in. Duke is thrown in the middle, and is forced to flounder around like a fish out of water.\nAs Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) would say \"WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!\"\nThe irony is when Duke voices your frustration as if he, too, is insulted to be a part of this game:\nEG1: Duke approaches a puzzle with pipes and valves. \"I hate Valve puzzles.\" Oh, lol, a quip about Valve's puzzles in HL2. So hilarious. Yeah, screw that. Duke's gonna punch his way through this one instead of doing the stupid puzz... oh... ok, nope, Duke has to do the flipping puzzle. Wut? (Even Angry Joe beat the game for that one.)\nEG2: In the DLC you get done with another stupid puzzle and Duke spouts \"FINALLY!\" Yeah, finally! Why am I stuck doing stupid puzzles?! Where's the flipping action?! If Duke himself is tired of this garbage, how do you think I feel?\nI'm not ticked off at Duke, though. I'm still a Duke fan, because this game merely mis-uses the Duke Nukem IP ... horribly ... and doesn't represent Duke well. Duke was thrown into the middle of this mess, and you're stuck feeling sad for him having to muck through it. You're frustrated at the game, but you're empathetic of Duke being stuck in it.\nDuke fans went in with certain expectations, and the game defied those expecations in ignorance, spite and / or neglect. But, that's not Duke's fault. That would be like buying a game that has Barbie in it and finding out it's a Mortal Kombat clone. It's not Barbie's fault, it's the fault of the ignorant developers / publisher.\nThe sad part is this isn't a bad game; it's just not a good Duke game. It would have done better had it been a stand-alone title starring a different lead character. Instead, Duke was shoe-horned in, and it doesn't work. As I said, they should have emulated Serious Sam, not Gordon Freeman.\nThe DLC is even more disappointing then the main game.\nDr. Proton (who? ... he was your antagonist from Duke 2D platforming days) starts as your chief antagonist, and it seems like a novel concept. But, they don't leverage his robots or Duke clones much, and you waste him 1/2 way in. What's left? Oh, you're stuck fighting more aliens like in DNF ... how original.\nAnd, they took everything that grates about DNF and put more of it in the DLC ... more puzzles, more driving, more platforming, more ball-scratching as you try to figure out where to go and what to do (which makes you feel like an idiot).\nIn addition, they neuter Duke mid-way through of his last, remaining machismo (his mouth) by having  some jack-a** side kick making all the wise cracks. So, the DLC is just insult to injury.\nBasically, if you're looking for a decent Duke Nukem 3D sequel, then go play Serious Sam. Sam picked up the baton that they made Duke drop, and has been running with it for the past years. Even playing Duke in Bro-Force is more entertaining than this. At least there's more action and more explosions.\nLikewise, look at my play time... 20 hours in 2 weeks. I'm on winter break from college; lots of time on my hands to catch up with my gaming. I spent ten hours a week on DNF. That's sad. When I really like a game I'll make a day of it. But, I found myself making excuses to not play this game... laundry, dishes, folding, vacuuming ... my apartment has never been cleaner. I started playing the game to see what all the fuss was about, and once I started I wanted to see it through. But, I found myself waffling hardcore getting there. That speaks volumes.\nIf you get this game, go in with expectations set per above. Don't go in thinking Duke is about action. In fact, don't have any expectations. Even 12yo's are ranting about how they're insulted that they used a lot of T & A to lure them into this stinker.

The storyline is very predictable and the game isn't exactly a graphical powerhouse. This game is however one of the most satisifying first person shooters I have ever played. Almost all of the games weapons are unique and fun to use and this game makes one of gamings greatest sins, backtracking, actually enjoyable. This is done with clever implementation of a device that shrinks Duke to action-figure size. You will go through a level as tiny Duke, and then go backwards as the normal sized Duke. Each version of Duke (tiny/normal) will face different obstacles. This is level design done right.\nThe game does have a few new weapons to play around with, but most of them aren't very interesting or just plain underpowered, but they make up for this by always having ammo within reach, thus making it an expendable weapon, and also the ultimate backup in case your main weapons empty out.\nSome things are just downright stupid in this game. Duke can only carry 2 weapons at a time. This can be icnreased to 4 on the pc version. A Duke Nukem game should let you carry lots of weapons. Just look at half life 2, Gordon Freeman can carry 10+ weapons, so having a maximum of 4 is just unnacceptable.\nThe game has plenty of references, as you would expect from a Duke Nukem game. None of them break the immersion from the game too much, and it's actually really nice to see them in there. You can tell the developers had fun with this game.\nEven after the long wait, Duke Nukem Forever is still just a Duke Nukem game.

I played through for the first time on hard difficulty, and aside from frustration with a few of the bosses, it wasn't overly challenging. The weapon and enemy variation is small, but it does the job.\nWhere this game shines is all of the extra stuff available in the game. Interacting with the world is actively encouraged as it raises your max health, but there's plenty of stuff that offers no game benefit yet really adds to the atmosphere. I probably spent a good hour just reading all the labels in the Duke Burger level. There's 9-ball, air hockey, pinball and more stuff that you don't need to even look at to finish the game, but would be missed if not included.

I really did.\nWhen early reviews criticized the game for poor graphics, crude/outdated humour, dumb AI, and linear levels, I gave the game the benefit of the doubt and hoped that the bad reviews stemmed from unrealistic expectations - expectations that were inflated to reflect the 10+ years that the game was supposedly in development for.\nHaving spent many, many hours with DNF, I regret to say that the game is indeed a disappointment. It isn't all bad. Aside from inexplicably playing too much like a Halo/COD clone for my liking, I find the game's biggest issue to be the technical problems that have put me in a position to constantly replay the beginning of vehicle-based levels because something about those levels significantly ramps up the extent to which the game locks up/freezes on my computer.\nHere is an analysis of the major factors that comprise this game:\nPLOT: There is a plot, but it's pretty weak and uninspired. If anything, it gets in the way of the action that this game revolves around since there are instances where you're foreced to wait for NPCs who are blocking your path to stop talking until you can proceed to your next objective. Listening to these NPCs should be optional!\nGRAPHICS: For the most part, they look fine for what they are. Duke Forever never aspired to be the graphical successor to Crysis, so it's silly to compare it to such graphically astounding titles. Although the enemies look cool and much more menacing than they did in Duke Nukem 3D, some of the backgrounds seem very bland (i.e. Duke's Hotel) or feature details that stand out as very, very pixelated (i.e. Sunshine reflecting off of the wall of a large barn in the 'Ghost Town' map). The game looks a little too dark and gritty for my liking.\nSOUND: The reworked theme song notwithstanding, the game's music is nothing to write home about. The sound effects, on the other hand, are very well done. Jon St. John's voice acting for Duke is superb; it lends the game personality and makes me laugh because it is just as buffoonishly over the top and anachronistic as it was when Duke first started speaking in 1996.\nCritics who whine about how dated Duke Nukem comes across in DNF need to get their heads checked. Telling anonymous women to \"Shake it, baby!\" wasn't politically correct in the mid- to late-90s, but most of those who condemn Duke for continuning to objectify women in a similar fashion in 2011 incorrectly imply that his behaviour was excusable in D3D because it was in-line with the times. It wasn't. Duke was - and remains - a parodic embodiment of sex, drugs, violence, and machismo taken to absurd extremes.\nMy favourite element of Duke Nukem Forever is the re-worked Holoduke accessory. Whereas it was conceptually cool but not very practical in Duke Nukem 3D, using it in DNF cloaks you in a Predator-style skin and produces a holographic replica of Duke that messes up his catchphrases. These botched lines ALWAYS crack me up! An added bonus is that the holographic image of Duke is now genuinely distracting to human foes: it moves around and appears to shoot like an actual multiplayer opponent would.\nGAME DESIGN: Sadly, DNF's maps are super linear. Whereas levels in D3D could be navigated a multitude of ways and were chock-full of secrets that encouraged and rewarded exploration and taking chances, navigation in Duke Nukem Forever can usually be summed up like this: move into a corridor; defeat all of its enemies; move into the next corridor. Rinse and repeat.\nOne of Duke 3D's very best levels - Hollywood Holocaust - was recycled into DNF as a multiplayer-only map. The redone map gives away all of original's secret areas; you literally need do little more than walk or fly around to discover virtually every inch of this map. Now there are no switches to trigger, no walls to blow up, and practically no skill is involved to see everything there is to see. This remade level is a microcosmic representation of what what you get when you compare the spirit of D3D's level design to that of DNF's.\nThe game's shooting mechanics are solid, but the weapon, ammunition, and health systems they are closely linked to really detract from my enjoyment of the game. Because the game arbitrarily imposes a low weapon limit, most enemies will become sources of ammo or new weapons once they're slain. Players feel no incentive to fight carefully, conserve ammo, or seek it out in hidden places, because they're practically guaranteed to have an ample arsenal whenever the dust of a skirmish settles. The health system is even worse; Duke's health regenerates over time. You can be completely careless about the way you fight and have the confidence of knowing that you'll come out with 100% health so long as you're patient enough to wait a few seconds before advancing to take on the next batch of enemies.\nTo the credit of DNF's developers, they found a creative way of excusing the shift from a traditional health system to one aping that of Halo/COD: It's not Duke's health that gets hurt in battle, but rather, his ego. So long as Duke's over-confident, over-inflated sense of self worth remains above a set threshold, he keeps on going. He doesn't need to pick up health packs; he just needs a few seconds to clear whatever abuse he just withstood from his mind to feel as good as new. I don't like this new system, but I like the logic that went into implementing it into Duke Nukem Forever.\nCONTROL: For the most part, the game controls fine. I really only have two gripes about it. First, in-game VoIP Chat is spotty. Whereas I can count on Left 4 Dead to always broadcast my voice when I'm wearing a headset and I have the game configured to read any input from it, I have had mixed results getting others to hear me in DNF. On a more serious note, I recently gave up on playing the game because of a long-standing conflict between some of 2K's titles and Steam: a bug triggered by the Steam Overlay prohibits you from moving around. I have spent considerable time trying to un-do this bug, and have given up - mainly because I have already spent tons and tons of time struggling with a problem that has plagued me since I first started playing the game: Intermittent freezing.\nTECHNICAL QUALITY: DNF freezes on me. A LOT. Every time it freezes, the game's window locks up, the sound stutters, and I have to manually launch the task bar and force DNF to abort its operations for my system to be useful again. The freezing symptoms seem to happen at random, but occur a HELL of a lot more frequently when I have to get around by monster truck rather than on foot. Because players are forced to spend the first half of \"Ghost Town\" zooming around in a truck, I spent way more time loading, aborting, and restarting that section of the game than I would like to admit. It would almost always freeze within 3 seconds of playing the stage, and fiddling with the game's graphical and sound options didn't make a damned bit of difference in terms of reducing the problem.\nMy computer's hardware is  more than capable of handling DNF on max settings, yet no game I've attempted to play has handled anywhere as poorly as DNF. My drivers are all up to date. I've tried compatibility modes. I even reluctantly made the switch from Windows 7 to Windows 8, yet not even that resolved the freezing issue.\nCONCLUSION: Duke Nukem Forever is not a great game in its own right, but I still enjoyed it enough to want to reach its climax. However, the crippling bugs I outlined not only soured my impression of the game, but convinced me to never, ever spend money on another PC port by publisher 2K Games (The freezing bug also affects Bioshock).\nQUICK RECAP: Mostly good graphics.

While it is worth playing for once just for the amusement factor. And yes if you look away from the fact that this game isn't the Duke Nukem most hoped for and pla pla. Well it is still not really good, the graphics are decent but not that good the texture quality is just poor for 2011 also why is there only FXAA? Why no MXAA or something like that?\nBut there are other problems too, the difficulty is not that big of a deal mostly you can play it on arder dificulties just fine because the for the most times your cause of death isn't the difficulty and your skills they are just damn cheap!. Seriously sometimes the boss toss something in the direction where you are supposed to hide so you can't anymore and than when you are just low at health they toss rockets at you, because they don't have such great pattern. Also allot of deaths where you just shot the guys and than: \"Holy Shot where did that came from?\" and you are dead, I really love it when there is a turret section and at the end a ship flys over you and you are supposed to know that the turret section is now over and it will shoot missle at you in such a rate that you can't run at all. Also some Enemies you think you know what is going on and than there come dozens of enemies. I mean at least you know after that that they are comming but at every new section that happens. Also I am not very found of the idea of self closing door. Because I like to go trough a door and just backwards out of it again to get some cover.\nAnd nope I am not just baaad at games, Normaly I see that it was my fault when I die in games and hey I've made it trough Fallout NV in the hardcore mood just fine even that game had crapy controlles, but it wasn't that cheap. Even the new Rise of the Triad I made it trough in harder Dificulties, damn I've even done Duke Nukem 3D on the Hardest Difficulty. And yes they are damn hard but they are not cheap like this game.\nAlso sometimes the weapons seem to do damn♥♥♥♥♥♥ the shotgun seems to be the best option because it kills the aliens the fastes, but just in short range. Also normaly you can shoot a pig with one shot but sometimes you need 3, Why? No Idea!.\nAnd also I really hate how the redone the Freezergun, seriously in 3D it froozes Enemies in about no time. But here it takes some seconds so you could also use a shotgun. And not to mention that on raving pigs it doesn't work, at all. You can't freeze them. At least the shrunk gun is still pretty fun.\nAlso did I mention that Pigs can rave now, I don't think that is pretty nice in this specific game, where in Borderlands the Goilats where made fine you could tell when they where about to explode and rage at you and here it sometimes seem to happen at random and also they ♥♥♥♥ing kill you fast. They don't seem to fit very well expecially if you just had fun with some guns and than there is a ♥♥♥♥ing raging pig that kills you.\nAlso Explosions, stay away from Explosions but the aliens don't bother they have to stand right next to the barrel to die from it, also the pipebombs are not that harmfull for a crowed of enemies. Yeah right, like back to 3D it was allot of fun, hell also in allot of other games but here they are way more dull.\nThere are some really nice things like the Ego System that does allot of fun also that you gain strenght for a while after drinking a beer but Duke doesn't seem to handle beer very well, one can of american beer and everything gets blury also he burps allot like he has some digesting problems!.\nAll in all just buy it if you are a die hard fan or if you want some ammusement, but all in all it is pretty bad as a full prize so try to get it cheap.", "hours": 13.1, "username": "エズィデニアサ", "products": 363, "early_access": false},

Not at all a game that deserves a metascore of ~50/100.\nThe interaction with the game world is great. You can lift weights, play pinball or pool, sign autographs, drink beer, take a leak, etc. Especially the beginning and the strip club level shine in this regard. This interaction with the world makes the game pretty unique. The action is solid and the fights are pretty challenging (I play on hard mode). The only thing that's not fun is the driving: The game is filled with driving sequences and they get a little annoying over the time.\nPros:\n- Great interaction with the environment\n- Silly Duke Nukem humor\n- Solid shootouts\n- Simple retro fps: No unfitting skill/experience system (The new Shadow Warrior is doing this unfortunately...)\n- Lenghty campaign: Much longer  than your average modern fps\n- Cool weapons: Shrinking cannons, freezing cannons, etc. The game keeps the cool weapons from Duke 3d\n- Variety of different environments: Casinos, deserts, organic alien environments, etc. The levels don't get boring\nCons:\n- Dated graphics: especially outdoors, but the game has its moments (sometimes it actually looks good).\n- Almost no blood! This really bugs me. Enemies often explode into meaty pieces, but leave no blood decals. I would expect much more blood from Duke Nukem.\n- Unfitting weapon restrictions / regenerating health: Strange modernizations in an otherwise old-school game. It should use health packs and it should let you carry all your weapons at the same time. While initially you were only allowed to carry two weapons, a patch changed that number to four. Still: This shouldn not be restricted at all.\n- Tedious driving sequences\n- No mod support: Duke Nukem 3D had a great modding community, and it even has today. Not supporting mods for this one is just stupid.\n~75/100 would be a fitting score, I would go as far as giving it 80+.", "hours": 21.6, "username": "MrNagasaki", "products": 471, "early_access": false},

Graphics are OK but physics are really cool, they've gotta be just as good as Half-Life 2 but, then again, Half-Life 2 came out much earlier. The regenerating health doesn't make this game that much easier, ESPECIALLY when playing in normal or hard mode.

The slow loading textures can be annoying but wait a second and they'll be fine, i personally got used to them really quickly and they rarely show up. Just when the combat is getting repetitive they trow in a new enemy or a mini-boss. I personally really enjoy this game and if your a Duke fan, you should too.

I remember those weekends listening to Don Henley's greatest hits, playing that game, and messing around with the build editor (my first and only experience designing FPS maps) quite fondly. At the time the next Duke Nukem game was a huge freaking deal to me. After a few years I lost my patience and moved on, like any normal person. Fast forward another decade or so and finally Duke Nukem Forever arrives, and it's garbage. No wait, that's just what they say right? I'm more than capable of playing games and formulating opinions on them, so who cares what they say.\nSo I played through it....\nDuke Nukem Forever is ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hate using bad language in reviews but DNF deserves all of it and more.\nThe original Duke Nukem 3D has a linear format, you go from one stage to the next. However those stages are large, varied, and include numerous optional paths, secret areas, and methods of exploration(jet-pack, steroid-boosted jumps, etc). Duke Nukem Forever is entirely linear. For the most part in DNF you're either shooting a handful of aliens in quasi-arena areas, doing some ridiculous puzzle, partaking in a vehicle-section, or doing some ego-boosting activity. Oh and for the entirety of the game your sensibilities on what makes for quality game-design or at least in-offensive content are dragged through horse manure.\nVehicle sections - All too often FPS developers feel the need to include vehicle-sections. They use the word \"variety\" which is short for \"we decided the actual game wasn't compelling\". Some developers can rise above, and that's because they use vehicles in an intelligent manner. Half-Life 2 is a good example, well I think it is at least. Yes a good chunk of the game is spent on a boat, but there are occasions where you have to be on foot to get things done. It feels organic, and makes for good pacing. The Halo series is also a good example, since vehicles feel like very much a part of the game, and are even optional depending on the circumstances.\nDuke Nukem Forever just didn't care. The developer looked at a checklist of what popular FPS titles did and said \"We need this, but let's not put in the effort to make it quality.\" Vehicle-sections are a constant in DNF, and none of them are entertaining. Early on you're controlling an RC truck, a stage or two later you're driving an RC truck, not long afterwards you're driving a monster truck (that runs out of gas at specific points), then you're riding in a mine-cart, driving a forklift(wtf?), and so on. I'm probably forgetting a few instances but that's probably for the best. The main point is that DNF has vehicle-sections because they needed to pad the game out somehow.\nThe combat/gun-play - When you're making a first-person-shooter the shooter aspects should be compelling. There are several games that get this most basic element right. Duke Nukem Forever...doesn't. For a 1996 game, Duke Nukem 3D still holds up in the shootin' department. It's fast-paced, crunchy, and aliens make all kinds of nasty and gratifying noises when you splatter their guts. Shooting aliens in DNF isn't fun because there's no satisfying feedback. The over abundance of pig cops are the perfect example. They barely react when you're firing away at them, until they just sorta collapse when they die. If feels disconnected, like Duke didn't really kill them. What's also ridiculous is the lack of new enemies. Fifteen years should have been plenty of time to come up with some new aliens to design. With the technology available we should've seen some really creative stuff that pushes the envelope. Instead it's mostly the same enemies we saw back in 1996. Everything's the same, just crappier. This is especially apparent with the final boss fight against the Cycloid Emperor. He's the final boss of Duke Nukem 3D, the first boss of Duke Nukem Forever (in a nod to the first game), as well as the final boss. Good Lord.\nPuzzles - When it comes to puzzles in an FPS, I'm firmly in the neutral camp. A little something to break up the action never hurts, as long as it isn't overbearing and doesn't screw with the pacing. DNF fails in this regard as well. Duke Nukem 3D was never the \"thinking man's\" shooter. Yes there were puzzles but they were more along the lines of flipping certain switches. The most elaborate puzzle took seconds to figure out. Naturally DNF has lots of puzzles. Alot of the time I felt like I was playing a seventh-rate Half-Life clone. None of it fits, very rarely is it clever, and it's just not fun. Defeating the Alien Queen requires bouncing pipe bombs off of trampolines. This is terrible. Every second Duke is hit by something that puts him into critical health. This is terrible crap.\nThe most bewildering addition is the ego system. In this game Duke recovers health (aka ego) when not taking damage. Boosting ego is done through a variety of actions, and they're almost all ridiculous. I can understand pumping iron giving an ego boost, but looking at pictures of women? What? It's a nonsensical system, but it's also kinda necessary because otherwise Duke dies too easily. This is the same guy that says \"power armor is for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Yeah, and taking cover almost constantly just to recover health is totally badass.\nWhat really gets under my skin is that the humor in DNF is forced, painfully unfunny, and oft-times just plain awful. The timeliness of most of the jokes are just brutally bad, like the Olsen-twins esque pop-stars in the intro, \"America, ♥♥♥♥ Yeah!\", and well..you get the idea. Over the course of DNF's development hell, all of the jokes were kept in, even though most of them ceased being funny almost a decade ago. There's also this secondary character named Dylan. I still can't believe anyone thought he was a good idea. When he got killed off I kicked his corpse into a pool of electrified water. Naturally he returned in the expansion alive and well. I hate this game.\nAnd yeah I played through the expansion. I'll admit, there were some neat moments (the clones mainly). The final boss is a vehicle section however and that's just unforgivable. Multiplayer is also available and uh...it wasn't that bad, at least compared to the rest of the game. It's not saying much sure, but at least it says SOMETHING.\nThere's a lot more I could be discussing about Duke Nukem Forever. There's that dream sequence where Duke is in a strip-club doing menial tasks for a lapdance, the plot(?), the misogyny, the--- eeeggghhhAHAHghhh! Forget it, I'm done talking about this mess.\nSKIP", "hours": 11.8, "username": "pepsimanvsjoe", "products": 1577, "early_access": false},

Pointing out the good and bad of the game.\nAhh, we've been waiting forever for Duke Nukem Forever. An game that's been In developement hell for 12 years. And the squeal to Duke Nukem 3D, and DNF basically Ignored the past Duke spin-offs like Zero Hour, Land of the Babes, and Time to Kill. Since THIS IS, a squeal to Duke3D.\nNow, this game Is known for being an pretty bad game, reviewers mostly point out the flaws Instead of the good. There Is some good, there Is some bad. The Good, Is Duke himself, he hasn't changed much, not one bit. The Babes are back (they do look souless xD), the weapons from Duke3D return once again, and the combat Is pretty good. The Bad, Is the wall boobs (yes, there Is wall boobs, you can slap them), the jokes aren't as clever anymore, they're more Immature once and a while. The regenerating health, and two weapon thing (there Is an option to expand the Inventory). They tried mixing classic FPS and modern FPS, the two. Really don't go together, but DNF kind of done It right. The game was pretty fun, It's kind of addicting also. Specially the Muiltplayer. But, there IS some hackers In the Muiltplayer. Which kind of makes It, not so fun at times. So, I'd suggest getting out of a game If you spot an hacker.\nWell, the story feels more like a rehash or retelling of Duke3D, Ailens have returned to Earth once again to capture the women, and Duke yet again has to save the world. Simple story for simple fun! The levels are an bit linear at this time, but they're fine.\nThe game also has an DLC which gives you another campiang called The Doctor Who Cloned Me. (I haven't tried this out yet).\nAnd some Muiltplayer DLC which adds more maps.\nWould I recommend DNF? Well, sure It has some flaws and It's hated on deeply. But Hey, It's better than Postal 3, which Is an game RWS doesn't want you to even buy! DNF has some good In there, and It's totally recommended.

Duke Nukem: Forever had big shoes to fill, and while it doesn't live up to the hype surrounding its release, it's definitely an enjoyable game despite the flaws.\nThis game has you once again playing as the Duke, living life as a celebrity after crushing the alien invasion in the previous game. The intro of the game has you reliving an awesome fight from the previous game before navigating your house and heading to an interview. While you'll notice the dodgy animations and skewed voicework, you'll also notice the astonishing amount of interactivity and abundance of items in the environment. Numerous posters and various memorabilia concerning Duke Nukem is scattered around the levels, and displays an enormous amount of fan service. You can interact with a large number of items in the environment, including pool tables, telephones, DVD players, toilets, vibrators (?), food, arcade games, weights, basketball, frisbees and even an actual turd (?). This lends itself to the novelty and humour of the game and was definitely one of the standards.\nWhile the actual combat in the game isn't awful, it does feel clunky and dated by today's standards. Many of the weapons lack punch, and end up feeling as if you're firing a glorified water gun. The only satisfying gun in the game is the shotgun, which is relatively to find and locate ammunition for. The rest of the guns are clumsy and spongy to use on enemies.\nUnfortunately, the level design is also quite linear. There's little exploration to be had, and it's relatively easy to find objects like ammo pickups. The constrictive and repetitive level design gets repetitive pretty quickly, and the blandly grey environments don't help this very much.\nThe boss fights in this game are surprisingly solid, and reminded me of old school games like Doom 3. These fights are entertaining and bombastic, but frustrating in that you can only damage them with a single weapon type. This limits the players style and actively forces you to play the game in a specific way. The game's real problem is the lack of creativity and restrictive mechanics, which contradicts the content found in Duke Nukem 3d.\nThe best way to experience Duke Nukem: Forever is the same as a popcorn action movie; turn your brain off, play it once, and don't look too carefully into it. The fun moments in this game make up for the bad ones, and the nostalgic value of this game probably elevated my score slightly. 7 / 10", "hours": 29.6, "username": "PrimalHunter", "products": 472, "early_access": false},

Plus the standard negative stuff about DNF has been beaten to death over and over again in a way that would make Duke himself blush. So I'll try not to fall into that trap.\nIt's hard to talk about Duke because the games and the man himself is 80% gimmick and 20% one liners. This was no exception. So I can't just say it was too gimmicky. Because no♥♥♥♥♥♥Sherlock,  it's Duke Nukem. Problem is, there was 98% gimmick, 10% one liners and 0.5% things to kill. That was the big negative to me. There was too much focusing on memes that were sometimes not even duke related. There was too much gimmick happening and not enough shooting stuff. Like the minigames that are almost memes themselves at this point. It was like the game was trying to make up for lost time in the self-referential humor and thus you got huge spans of non-action sequences like the strip club. Make no mistake, Duke has always been about being cheesy and awesome and killing swathes of enemies. But this didn't have much of that all things considered.\nNow let me get something straight, I'm a straight man and like any straight man I like women and I like boobs. I've seen and touched many of both in my time. So believe me when I say that there were way,\ntoo many instances of \"omg look boobs!\" Just way too many, it's what you'd expect either a kid or a sexually frustrated adult to put into a video game. Like I said before lots of boob is perfect for Duke because he's Duke. Which is why the strip clubs in the original games were just fine. It was over the top and just great. But this is over the top to the point where someone fell down and broke their neck.\nOther thing that almost made me create a review just to rant was the ♥♥♥♥ing hoover dam underwater ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Holy crap. This level frustrated me almost to the point of just stopping right then and there. I don't like underwater levels in 3D games in the first place but I do acknowledge they can be done right. This wasn't. It brought the pace of the game to a screeching halt even worse than the non-action sequences. I died more times in the leech fight and the area near it than anywhere else in the game including the final boss (which I actually died 0 times on so that should say something). Simply because I couldn't move fast. I know you're  thinking \"you just have no skill\". Maybe that's true, but this was not a matter of skill. Skill cannot be used when you move like a bug through taffy. It gives you little opportunities to artfully dodge like you could in just about every other game.\nThat said, the final fight made up for it and it was suitably epic. Still, not sure I can recommend it. Even though I think the absolute nail biting hate towards it is kind of silly I do understand to an extent. It's not faithful to the material. Even though I love hearing Jon and all that. It just lacked the gameplay. Which was a gigantic part of Duke 3D and such. If you liked those there is no real guarantee you'll like this one. There's just not enough gameplay and too much pandering and meme-whoring and not enough of what made the series great in the first place: Killing things.

Now I know what you're thinking: \"But you seemed to like it, why would you not recommend the multiplayer\"? Well, it's quite simple. I liked the multiplayer because it reminded me a lot of Unreal Tournament, one of the greatest multiplayer games ever. It then struck me that it would be a much better idea to just go buy one of the Unreal Tournament games instead of buying this for its multiplayer component.

The game attempts to reference Duke Nukem's past, and they do an alright job of it. The storyline itself is rather longish, with different puzzles, interactive scenes and boss fights to keep you occupied along the way, The voice acting could have used more work (especially the way they made Duke Nukem generally sound), and even though the storyline is longish it still seems like once you've finished the game it was too short.\nThe DLC \"The Doctor Who Cloned Me\" gave the game a bit of a boost along with it's nearly dead but still alive multiplayer community. These two should give you a bit more gaming time. I would recommend getting this game when it's on sale because the normal price to buy it is currently too much in my opinion for what this game offers. Hardcore Duke Nukem fans would probably enjoy this very much, but younger gamers or gamers that are not familiar with the Duke Nukem series would not understand the raunchy references this game makes or the style of humor that Duke Nukem has always used.\nOverall, this game on sale + the DLC and multiplayer would be pretty fun for a casual gamer to play. There are also many references to other games that came out around the time that Duke Nukem Forever came out; casual gamers would definitely enjoy that.", "hours": 26.8, "username": "Frosty The Blowman", "products": 187, "early_access": false},

Screw you, you're only holding 2 guns at a time.\n- The game is linear. No keycards, no switches, nothing. Just straight forward.\n- No puzzles. I only got like one or two of these and they weren't memorable. You won't be spending your time with them.\n- The level design is just awful. As I said, the game is a corridor, so don't expect those rooms and layers you're used to on a normal Duke Nukem game.\n- The soundtrack didn't seem fitting. I miss that bassy MIDI songs.\n- Health recovery like CoD or Halo games killed 50% of the fun. You won't be begging for medikits, you just get behind a cover and wait.\n- Gun impact felt bland. Gunplay was very dull.\n- Shooting sections feel cheap. They lock the room and throw enemies at you. That's pretty much it.\nAnd what went right:\n+ I like the new guns.\n+ Multiplayer was a fun mode but it was condemned since day one.\n+ It's Duke Nukem. He's that guy full of one liners and wrong jokes.\nBut that's about it. Duke Nukem Forever feels and plays like a unfinished and unpolished game. It feels like a beta through the whole game.

While it has some strengths, like some genuinly awesome moments and a reasonably solid shooter mechanic, the game is unfocused at best, assuming that the ood, out of place gimmicks that have been awkwardly inserted are actually fun. If they are fun, then the game will have you doing them until you hate them.\nThe biggest problems for me were:\n1) Sexual innuendos, nudity, etc. This is duke nukem ,so we expect them to be there. BUT THEY WEREN\"T FUNNY.at best it was sort of sad, most of the R-rated content in the game felt like it was tacked in as an afterthought, The pointless ♥♥♥♥♥ city level is the best example of the lack of thought put into the game.\n2) Checkpoint saves only? REALLY?! The 90s game let you save whenever you wanted, The checkpoint save means you get to repeat furstrating, difficult parts over and over again. the platformer style puzzles in particular are a hellish nightmare because of this.\n3) genuinely fun features, like the monster truck for instance, are ruined by beign constantly repeated and continued long after they sop beign amusing. even worse, stupid gimmicks like the shrunken platformer puzzles, racecar driving, and looking for junk in a hullucinated strip club, are alos drawn out.\nOverall, if you can get this game cheap, its probably worth trying, its also worth grabbing if your a fan of the classic games. The DLC is shockingly good value, it adds a full new campaign, and is worth getting if you like the main campaign well enough.

The guns have a nice feel to them, the alien weapons less so but the guns really feel powerful, and if that's not your thing you can always hurl weights into the faces of aliens which looks even more hard hitting.\nThe visuals are dated but that's how Duke 3D was, Quake was out shortly around Duke 3D and that didn't stop it from being fun eh?

His dark, slightly curly hair appears around the wall that separates the living room and the kitchen.\n“Welcome back. What did you get up too?” He asks and I see the rest of his head. His face is a lovely olive and his eyes a magnificent green.\n“Can’t I have an secrets?” I ask, as I am slightly ashamed of my whereabouts 30 minutes ago.\n“Come on Belle, I’m your best mate, it cant be that embarrassing, don’t you trust me any more?” He asks as he comes out of the living room looking impossibly handsome in a dark t-shirt and mid denim jeans.\n“Alright fine… I got a wax…” I say looking down at my skirt. I had hoped of keeping it a secret but as my best friend Chris knows I am not very good at keep secrets especially not from him!\n“Wow I never thought you would get one! That’s cool. Well can I have an exam?” He asks. I have secretly always had a thing for him but I decided it was best if we just kept being friends.\nAstonished by his request I took a step back and with an attempt to control my tone I asked: “why would you want to look at it and no you may not!” Secretly I wanted to show him, but that was out of the question.\n“Well you obviously got it done for someone and I merely want to check the quality of it. Is that a bad reason? Plus come on I’m your best friend.” He asked with a cute expression on his face which read ‘Trust me, you know you can!’\n“No!” I say as I walk down to the bathroom and as I shut the door I feel guilty that I said no to my one desire and to a face as gorgeous as his!\nI shrug it off and de clothe and hope into the shower, as that is what the lady told me too. As I washing my body I hear the bathroom door open.\n“Go away” I tell Chris.\n“Too late” He says as he opens the door and I see the most wonderful body in the world! It is toned and it is olive and it is strong, masculine and big! And that is not just his body!\n“Well, she did do a good job.” He says with a naughty little smile on his face as he kneels down to face my newly waxed pubic area.\n“What are you…” I start but soon stop as his mouth starts kissing me. I suddenly start to feel even more wet. Then his lips part and his tongue starts licking my ♥♥♥♥♥♥. He is so good; his tongue is roaming my entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hitting my♥♥♥♥♥♥multiple times a minute. I feel my knees buckle and soon I feel a pressure building up inside. As he hits my♥♥♥♥♥♥one more time I have my first ever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it feels brilliant. My knees then buckle completely and I land in his arms. That is when we kiss for the 1st time and it is magic. His tongue roams my entire mouth the way he did to my ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nThen I pull away about to ask why he is doing this when he brings me back for more kissing. Then I feel something start to stand up behind my back. I pull away once more but this time I make sure he can read my eyes.\nI stand up and move down so that I can repay the favour he had just given me. I lower myself so I am sitting naked on his thighs. Then I start to rug his 9-inch♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and I can feel it harden instantly. Then I start to lower my lips to it but stop right before I am able to kiss it. Instead I move my lips to the side and start kissing his testicles. He shivers. Eventually I can’t stand it any more. I place his♥♥♥♥♥♥in my mouth and start sucking it like crazy! I can feel him shiver and moan with pleasure. Then I start licking while I suck. Soon I feel the pressure break and hot seamen races into my mouth. Then I move my moth away and his♥♥♥♥♥♥is spraying my neck and chest with seamen, but the water from the shower washes me quickly. I then move my body up and then my lips find his lips again and we start kissing again. He roles me over with care in the shower. His moist lips part with mine and start traveling down my body when I stop him.\n“No, more kissing.” I say breathlessly and his lips return. Then his arms come around my back and brings me closer and my arms go around his back and starts messaging his back.\nThen his lips part mine again.\n“Come on” He says to me.\nHe steps up wobbly then turns off the shower than leans back down and assists me up then he quickly opens the door and then embraces me and lifts me up and rests me on his hips then subsides into my kissing again. We walk to his bedroom and he places me carefully onto his bed and then pushes me up so that my head is on his pillows. While still kissing me incredibly he reaches into the top draw in his bedside table and pulls out a condom. Quickly he puts it on himself then he enters me. Pushing himself slowly in and out. I start to shiver in joy. Then I feel metal on my wrists. I stop kissing him for a moment.\n“Let me take charge of your pleasure, if you ever want me to stop then just say so, but please try it with me.” He says and ends with a little kiss.\n“Alright” I agree just wanting to kiss him more.\nHe starts penetrating himself again inside me, but then speeds up, faster, harder he pushes.\nThen we both explode into ♥♥♥♥♥♥s again. I feel his hot seamen and my hot♥♥♥♥♥mixing and we take a moment to pause from kissing and then he lowers his mouth to my neck and starts moving it down towards my pulsing ♥♥♥♥♥♥. He gives me oral again and it is even better than the first. Once he has finished with me again he moves again up.\nAs he releases my restraints I quickly roll him over and cuff him to the bed.\n“My turn” I say and then I start rubbing his♥♥♥♥♥♥with one hand and rubbing my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the other. I see his mouth start to drool as I bring both him and myself to ♥♥♥♥♥♥s again. I stop rubbing myself when I feel ready to burst. I then take my hand which is feeling very wet and I start rubbing it along his face then, while still rubbing his hardened♥♥♥♥♥♥I start licking his face. Once I feel satisfied with his hardened♥♥♥♥♥♥I mount him and we start having more sex.\nAgain we ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then I release his restraints and then I collapse on his heaving chest.\n“I have waited so long for that, man Chris, I love you.” I admit\n“I love you too Belle.” He says as he rolls sideways and then turns me around and we lie facing each other like I had dreamt for the past 4 years.\nWe just lay there in each other’s arms soaking wet from the shower talking.

Whilst the aliens from Duke 3D return, promising peace and cookies instead of butt-probing and war.\nAnd take a wild quess actually happens.. They do come in peace.. Just to f*ck you over if you actually believed it.\nNo seriously, i cannot talk about the story because Duke Forever decided to take the good ol' design decision of shooters of yore, to actually have no story at all. And even if Forever had a story, it still would have been a pile of w*nk.\nSeriously Duke Forever is a decent in the shooter department, and pretty much s*it at everything else.\nMostly impaired by the design decisions, made in the mythical eons ago when they decided to create a sequel to Duke 3D. Looking at the shiny newcomers and quite sadly trying to ape all of them and trying its hardest to innovate with the concept.\nI'm suddenly reminded of an old picture in the ICanHasCheeseburger sister-sites.

Jumps with a ridiculous \"hungh!\" That i bet sounds like all the other Dukes \"effort\" noices. Only open his flappy mouth to spurt one-liners, that although some were mildly humorous, they still did not fill anything in the enjoy department.\nGunplay, although being the only part that is even with the slightest redeeming value. Feels anemic as all hell and even after they patched the stupid design decision of only carrying two (2) guns, to the extreme number of four (4), wont make it any better, since all the weapons are about as interesting as pea-shooters, with annoyingly limited ammo and not enough ammo in the levels to justify carrying four (4) butt-violators to battle. Indeed i had to continually change my loadout after i noticed, that certain level either had no weapons and enemies, or only having two (2) or three (3) weapons that i did not have in my loadout, and had to change my most explody weapons into these anemic pea-shooters..\nAnd the level design.. Although i could pull the argument that Duke 3D also had somewhat bleak areas and generally dark themes, I still feel that Duke 3D still has lot superior level design than Duke Forever, surpricing no one ever. I feel that i should plaster the \"evolution of shooter levels\"-Picture here, but i think i'l just let you google that... Anyway where was i ?\nOh yes levels, BORING.\nIn all and all, Duke Forever is terrible, but in a good way. I'm going to pull the Terrible good movie argument here.\nDuke Forever feels like a terrible late 80's early 90's action-film and is that a bad thing, not really unless you use that as the only response in a debate. Duke Forever fills the BS-Meter all too well, and is in the level many terrible movies, with equally sh*t jokes, terrible storyline, shooting and deaths of useless extras and minor supporting-roles. But as a game, Duke flops flat..\nAnd he requires ton of \"little-helpers\" to get into working order. Unfortunately for Dukie, the helpers are console-generation tropes and design decisions that are more butter-buttons than actual medication.\nDuke Forever, get the all too generous: D+", "hours": 17.4, "user_id": "76561198029852280", "username": "Valtheknight", "products": 494, "early_access": false},

Duke Nukem Forever was a blast to play! Everything from the strip club mini-games to the hardcore gunning action to the anti-air missions. For those of you who aren't familiar with the textbook case of \"Development Hell\", Duke Nukem Forver was a sequel planned almost immediately on the heels of its acclaimed predecessor, Duke Nukem 3D. Unfortunately, stuff happened, legal stuff happened, and a game was spat out around 2011. After seeing bits and snippets and reading up on some negative reviews, I finally bought it and played and, like I said, LOVED IT! Duke Nukem, having accumulated fame, fortune and everything else (a casino, a restaurant franchise, a strip club, etc.) from saving the Earth, gets his mood ruined when bastard aliens show up with less than diplomatic intentions. Duke Nukem has aspects of the Gears of War, HALO, Doom 3 and every other big name shooter instilled into its mechanics and is peppered with mini-games on the side (some pointless, some cool, some kinky), all the while staying true to its original origins of one-liners, violence, machismo and BABES. The mechanics were smooth, the gameplay was a little hard but not too hard, the graphics were beautiful, the weapon selections was great and the setup for everything was beautiful. So why did it get negative reviews? Not sure, but if I had to nitpick what may have been wrong with it, I'd say it was a little too linear. It had a very clear plot and story that the player has little choice but to follow along with. It's reminiscent of games like (2006 sleeper) Prey and Bulletstorm in this sense. Aside from that, it's everything you'd expect from a Duke Nukem sequel, so give it an honest try. It'll be in the bargain bin for the rest of its days, so what have you got to lose?!", "hours": 16.7, "username": "JakkelR4psc4llion", "products": 69, "early_access": false},

Back in the 90s most of us fell in love with Duke 3D. Not for its movie cliches or paying women for money, but for its non linear levels with a lot of exploration and guns. Well Duke Forever took away the non linear level design. Now Duke is stuck in some one dimensional levels. You'll visit the desert, a damn, a bar, an alien hive, his underground complex, get shrunk in a Duke Burger all on your journey to a tower. Duke isn't as fast as he used to be, so now he has vehicles every so often. You'll sit on and drive remote controlled cars and a giant monster truck that squashes enemies and uses nitrous boost for the jumps.\nI think my issue with this game is the first two hours felt like everything but first person shooting. The game throws a lot of distractions at you. An interactive museum dedicated to Duke, punching, playing pinball, driving, first person platforming and a turret section. It just seemed like the shooting was 15% of what Duke Forever was.\nOnce you get over the giant hill of the first two hours, the game feels like a Half Life 2-ish game and that's good. Duke's world has been taken over by aliens. If it didn't sound Half-Life 2 enough for you, Duke walks and drives his way to a massive tower with a beam of light extending to the sky. There is a checkpoint system and no exploration or secrets. There are a few simple physics puzzles here and there. Moving barrels to weigh things down. Stuff like that.\nThe game uses a typical Unreal / Gearbox with controls to thumbstick crouch, thumbstick sprint (forward only), weapon switch, grenade, trip mine, zoom aim, fire, melee, jump and actions / reload. There are quick D-pad controls for Duke's night vision, holovision (duke clone to distract enemies), steroids and beer.\nYou can only carry 2 weapons and switch between them. There is a good variety of weapons. A laser sighted pistol, alien laser, shotgun, triple barreled ripper machinegun, rail gun to snipe, RPG, chaingun, devastator, freeze ray, triple stinger missile launcher, trip mines, grenades and so on. Nothing feels like it has impact.\nThe enemy intelligence is pretty good. Berserker pigs will charge, pig soldiers will shoot at you, and if you hide, they will grenade you. Alien soldiers hover, teleport in and out and actually try to flank you. It makes for a nice dynamic. The only problem is a lot of the maps are so straight forward, they don't allow for being flanked. The boss fights are pretty easy and that's not a complaint. Just RPG them until they're low on health, run to them and uh button mash them to death.\nOther enemies from the franchise make their return. Octobrains swim, hover and shoot projectiles at you. Preginators jump and face stick onto you so you'll need to button mash to take them off. Hovering assault commanders that fire missiles at you. Overall, it seems like there aren't that many enemies, just different versions of them.\nThere are a few sections that confine you to an area and just have enemies flood in. It feels like a cheap way to extend gameplay, even if it does highlight enemy intelligence. Some enemy rooms are so simple that you see the enemy dropping in, so you can be there to shoot them point blank, taking away any kind of challenge or fun.\nIf this game wasn't Duke, I would have kept playing to realize there is an enjoyable game here past the first 2 hours.", "hours": 15.3, "user_id": "76561198019205444", "username": "sitebender", "products": 3265, "early_access": false},

That's pretty much it. From here on out, it's going to be nothing but downhill. I had to force myself to keep playing and even then, I simply couldn't take the pain anymore. The story goes - aliens attack and it's up to the Duke, an aging sterol junkie and narcissist to defend Earth. That sounds cool but in reality, the Duke rarely speaks and there is little humor (forget Bulletstorm, Borderlands, or Portal - this isn't even a warm up to comedy). The gameplay is nothing more than equip yourself with generic assault rifles and blast linear swarms of generic aliens. You do this several times before the pace is abruptly halted by generic platforming or unnecessary dialogue. The reality is the game doesn't know what it wants to be (think Postal but worse) so it tries to be everything. It tries to be humorous, fast, witty, serious - but it's not any of that.\nThe Duke is living in the past and you can clearly tell by the random ideas lumped together right before release. At best, this game was average for 1997 but by 2011's standards, it has fallen way, way, way below average. The score is nothing more than a bland overtune that puts you to sleep. The graphics and textures are very pixelated, bland, blurry, blocky, and poor. The AI is broken and commonly gets stuck on things. The multiplayer servers are deadier then Jake Lloyd's acting career. You could probably get it to run on a toaster but I doubt it (which is a good thing because the toaster might blow up and you'd need a new one). What's funny is the game is so bad, the developers realized it and took the time to make jokes about it. This does not excuse the fact that you had 14 years to make a game that played like it was done in just 14 days. I realize most of us got the game for cheap (<$5) but even then I felt I got ripped off. If I was paid to play this game and I had no other source of income, I would gladly take to the streets. Every attempt the game makes to succeed ends up in utter disgrace. I should also mention that this is my first Duke game so I went in expecting nothing. I ended up getting nothing (but grief).\nHere are some other words to describe this game: faulty, soulless, broken, inadequate, inferior, unacceptable, pitiful, wretched, destitute, deficient, unbearable, weak, disgraceful, insidious, malicious, malignant, failing, failure, failed, EA, Call of Duty, Battlefield Earth, The Third Reich, and the Biebister.\nI give this game a 2/10 (+1 for power armor, +1 duke voice).", "hours": 1.5, "username": "Swaggaccino", "products": 558, "early_access": false},

There is nothing new or inventive on this one as far as the gameplay is concerned. Gunning your way through each area is linear and there aren't any well hidden secrets or divergent levels to explore. It's fairly straightforward as far as first person shooters go, but I really dig the junior-high school humor and trashy one-liner jokes throughout Duke Nukem Forever.

I played and played, waiting to find the reason(s) so many people dislike this game but from the beginning to the end I found nothing significant enough to justify the hatred so many people have for Duke Nukem: Forever.\nThe gameplay was fun, the environments were interesting, the graphics and physics were good, the weapons were pretty diverse, the difficulty was well balanced, and most of the jokes and puns were funny enough to give me a little laugh. The game kept me interested enough to play it through to the end over the course of a few days and it never disappointed me or made me feel like it wasn't worth the money I paid for it. It was really an enjoyable experience and pretty much the opposite of what all these negative reviewers made it out to look like.\nSo, the question is; why was this game so bad in the eyes of so many? My best guess would be that it's due to a few different aspects. Maybe the game had problems when it was first released which have since been patched. Maybe it was hyped up so much that many people were expecting a groundbreaking game and were disappointed when they saw it wasn't. This game was supposed to be released many times over the course of about a decade and each time it was announced that it was to be released soon it ended up not happening each time. The reoccuring disappointment from that would be enough to make many gamers critical on it when it was finally released.\nThere were a few negative things I saw in this game, minor though they are, they're still worth mentioning. I saw a few small glitches such as that the pigcop freezes for a second in mid-air when he lunges towards you if you move out of the way. I also didn't find the characters in this game(other than Duke Nukem himself) particularly interesting or memorable, they were all pretty bland. The enemies didn't exactly have colorful personalities either but in a game like this they really don't need to do much else than look fierce and give you a good fight and those were two features they certainly had. Another thing is that to me there doesn't seem to be much replay value in this game, you pretty much see everything the first time around. Though after beating the game it unlocks a few bonus options and cheats which you may find interesting enough to play it through once again.\nEverything considered I feel like this is a good game. It's no Halo or Half life 2 or grand theft auto or Shenmue or Max Payne or Resident evil or any other groundbreaking game with a terrific storyline that will make you sit back in your chair once it's all over and say \"Wow, that was an incredible game\" but if you want a non-serious shooter with some comedy, pleasing visuals(B00BIES 0.0), fun gameplay and stupid things to play around with(dry erase boards, minigames, turds in toilets, light switches, microwaves, etc.) then this might just be the game to suit your needs. Just remember that game reviews are simply based on the opinions of that particular reviewer and a game they call bad could be a game you will thoroughly enjoy. If this game looks good to you, give it a shot. If it looks good but you're pessimistic due to the negative reviews you've seen then wait for it to be on sale and pick it up.

The game is tremendously under rated.  The campaign does start out a little slow aside from 1 encounter and it's really not the same style as Duke3D, but it's the same spirit and humor.  Where Duke3D took the FPS concept and made it better, Duke Forever didn't have nearly the impact on the genre that Duke3D did.  Success it not easily repeated.\nThe Doctor Who Cloned Me:\nIf you even somewhat enjoyed the campaign for Duke Nukem Forever then you should buy this, it starts off right where the campaign ended and it adds a heafty amount of gameplay for the money.  You can really see where the developers that the developers improved on what they already had.  The game just seemed to flow better, in terms of combat sequences, sections of finding things to boost your ego bar.\nMultiplayer:\nAside from the occasional lag and the hackers, this part of the game is extremely fun.  It's fast paced, aggressive, and there is the Jetpack.  There are plenty of maps especially if you get the DLC.  Everyone is on equal ground, it's multiplayer plays slightly like Quake, weapon spawns, power ups.  Back in the 90's when this game was announced I wasn't even thinking about buying this game for the multiplayer, but what a gem it turned out to be.  Most of my multiplayer playtime came when I owned a copy of this on the PS3, but I have played some on the PC too.  I loved it so much when I stopped playing I was top 15 in the world on PS3, I'm sure by now I've dropped off the top 100 but it was great times.\nWhen considering if this game is any good you have to consider it as a whole, did you have fun playing it at any point?  Ignore the fact that it was in development for so long and forget about the way Duke3D was, we all know how great Duke3D is, and no Duke Forever is not better than Duke3D, but it's still way more original that many of the other FPS that get released now a day.\nGame was released a few years ago, last regular price I saw was $40.00\nNot a great price for it, I recommend picking it up on a sale.

That said fact, it is not bad, either. The critics were way too harsh. Sure, there is a lot of puzzle solving elements that can get repetitive, and sure, the graphics look several years dated, but graphics are not what makes a game good and even the old Duke 3D has similar puzzle solving. Also, the long load times that people complained about are a non-issue on PC. It's less than 10 seconds, compared to up to 45 seconds for the console versions. And also, unlike on the consoles, you can carry up to 4 weapons (enable \"expanded inventory\" in the options menu) instead of only 2. This may not seem like a big deal, but carrying more weapons really does add to that older Duke feel. Honestly, this is not a bad game. Certainly not nearly as bad as most people claimed. If you can get past the dated graphics and a little reptetiveness at times (What game doesn't have its reptetive moments?) then Duke Nukem Forever really can be an enjoyable game.\nOne more thing I would like to add is how well PC optimized this game seems to be.

I see what they wanted to try, I really do, bring back the good 'ol classic shooter game 1999 style. But let's focus on the good things before and then let's point out the problems.\nThe game itself doesen't even look so bad, the textures are really good, and the graphic it's good looking, and can run smooth even on not-so-great pcs with high settings.\nThe gameplay it's fun.. for most of the time; there are many weapons, from the classic pistol to the weird alien ones. Not a lot of renovations of gameplay, and not everyone of them are actually good. Why does game desingers think that water level where you can drown are fun to play?\nThe game it's pretty long, and haves a lot of different locations. The map desing it's pretty good looking, but it's mostly a hallway for most of the game, and goddamnit, I never had problem with invisible walls, but here I couldn't reach almost nothing becouse of them. Jeez.\nAnyway, can't think of anything else. Let's focus on the problems.\nAs I said, this game is a straight up line, expecially at the beginning. The enemies aren't so much difficult to kill, and fortunatly the power ups are hard to find.\nThey added cars, but that didn't help much. Seriously, a monster truck? What am I, 6 years old?\nThe Humor it's terrible: maybe it's just me, but an alien with 3 boobs on his chests just gross me out. It seriously looks like the humor of Saints Row, stupid, childish and immature, and I hate it. But it had a few funny moments.\nI don't wanna waste more time finding all the little problems, but I just wanna point this out: this game doesen't have the main thing: it can't be 100% Duke nukem. For lot of parts I was feeling like playing another game; I don't know if they was references, probably yes, but lot of stuff was like ripped off from Doom 3, Half Life 2, Halo and for god sake, even Call of Duty. Easter eggs or not, that doesen't make the impression of a original game.\nFinal Score: 5+/10 for effort.\nAnd mostly understanding. 12 years in the making, 3 different games developers's houses.\nAt least it wasn't so much glitchy.

Did this game live up to all the hype from delay after delay? (Did Colonial Marines?) I think the general consensus is \"NO.\" but even with that in mind, lets take a look at the game and see what it's got going for it.\nDuke Nukem Forever is the long awaited sequel to the FPS Classic Duke Nukem 3D. It has all the crude humor, over the top violence, and macho-man attitude its predecessor is known for, but its lacking some things that helped previous titles become hits: Charisma. This game might have the violence and T&A the series is known for, but is lacking in charisma, class and not to mention the humor is far too low brow (even for a duke nukem game) to be funny. Now, at times it does have its funny and witty moments (driving around in a remote controlled car for example) but these moments are too few and far between, not to mention the level design can be incredibly frustrating and even dull at times. There is a multiplayer aspect to the game, but it's the most bare-bones pathetic excuse for multiplayer that nobody wants to play it, and speaking of multiplayer, this game made the ultimate sin of NOT HAVING CO-OPERATIVE GAMEPLAY. Many people wanted to like this game, but its makes itself very hard to like, is that dukes fault? No. If i had to put the blame on anything, its remaking the game too many damn times. The original trailers for the game looked nothing like this, and honestly, probably would have been better. But who knows?

{"product_id": "57900", "page": 283, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-01-27", "text": "You'll notice an overwhelming theme in reviews for DNF, where the leading reason for negative reviews are purely based on the hype that was built up for the game, or the fact that it wasn't DN3D for the modern generation. Most of the people that I know who hate on the game haven't even played it, but because IGN said it was bad, well, darnit, it must be terrible.\nIf you are expecting Duke3D, you will be disappointed. This is not the high-speed retro action game that represented the  technology of the Build engine.\nGo into this title remembering that it is from 2006. The current build of the game, graphics and otherwise, are from the last build of the game that 3D Realms worked on, which was abandoned and then picked up by Gearbox. While the graphics definitely aren't to par with titles that were released alongside it, nobody really should've expected otherwise.\nThe game itself doesn't break any new ground. Like most modern shooters, expect to be ducking under cover to allow your health to regenerate, swapping out weapons to accomodate the two weapon limit, and having gameplay mixed with driving and turret segments. However, one thing that Duke Nukem games have always had is an incredible amount of interactivity with the environment, something you just don't see in other games. Getting sodas from vending machines, playing pinball, writing on markerboards, seeing your current time reflected in the in-game clocks; they're mostly small touches, but something that more games need to embrace.\nThe combat is fairly straightforward. Unload in the direction of the nearest alien until there isn't much left. There isn't much need for ammo conservation unless you're toting a Shrinker or RPG, as you come across fresh guns and ammo caches fairly frequently.  The two gun limit was, admittedly, a major letdown, as no one really wants to use the Shrinker or the Freeze Ray as a primary weapon due to ammo being scarce, but being able to have one handy for whenever you DID want to use it was nice. They did patch in a 4-weapon limit, but since the game was designed around 2, there isn't much indication in the HUD which weapons you have or what key they're bound to.\nThe level variety is another place where DNF excels. From casinos, to dusty Vegas streets, to being shrunk in a fast food kitchen and fighting across the shelves, DNF does a great job at mixing up the levels. The driving segments were definitely underwhelming, with some pretty wonky vehicle physics. Luckily, none of those segments are too brutal and checkpoints are plentiful, so it's definitely not gamebreaking by any means.\nThe music is mostly forgettable, with some of the renditions of GrabBag standing out, but otherwise its fairly mundane battle music. The weapon sounds are hit and miss, with some weapons, such as the Ripper, sounding punchy and brutal, while others, namely the Shotgun, just don't feel powerful at all. The voice acting is also hit and miss, with some great performances by Jon St. John, and some mediocre work from pretty much everyone else. Some of the civilian NPC's are a bit painful to listen to.\nOverall, Duke Nukem Forever definitely wasn't the groundbreaking title everyone wanted, and it certainly wasn't Duke3D all over again, but that doesn't make it a bad game. The fact that it was released at all was pretty incredible, and if you can overlook the dated 2006 graphics and engine, and don't go into it with the mindset of some epic godly title that will blow your socks off, there is alot of fun to be had.\nalso kick♥♥♥♥♥ chew bubblegum etc.", "hours": 21.9, "username": "Jasozz", "products": 372, "early_access": false},

In the end, the poor reception of Forever is less that the game is genuinely poor (though it is quite uninspired) but that it hasn't grown up. The fratboys who loved it have either gotten jobs and kids and moved on, or they have matured. The audience which loved the crassness of the Duke 3D, the offensiveness of Postal, the schlock of Blood and the gleeful carnage of Carmageddon isn't really there anymore. And those other compatriates of Duke 3D have similarly not survived. Seen in that light, Forever is a way behind the times, and I wish I could say at least the game is solid. It isn't. It's vague, unreliable and frequently comes to a halt because of unclear objectives. Yet when this dinosaur works, it can be somewhat of a spectacle, but one which needs to be kept away from human populations.

But then I wouldn't recommend that unless you have a few bucks to spare and a sense of morbid curiousity for bile. That is to say, Duke Nukem Forever is not a broken game. It's not an incomplete game. Infact, nothing is overall glitchy or messy, and it's competent.\nBut does that make it good?\nForever tries to cash in on nostalgia to Duke Nukem 3D, but it reaches a point that Duke himself almost feels like a parody of his younger self, and that nostalgia is hollow at best with art design, ripped or altered quotes, and wholesale references. The Duke's lines seem like they were written by Comedy Central writers on a boring weekend, and a few very specific moments are just plain.. Unnecessary or even downright vexing as to how anyone thought it was a good idea.\nWhen the game you're referencing is better than the your own game, however, that becomes a significant issue. And in all regards, Forever falls down the cesspit that is a modern shooter without much ingenuity. Regenerating health (coined as 'Ego', but extremely inconsistent on how much damage you can actually sustain), bland gunplay with no real kick or impact beyond the shotgun blast, dumb-as-bricks enemy AI that either stands perfectly still or rushes you, turret and vehicle sections thrown in for 'variety' that drags players down when they last way too long, rudimentary puzzles to pad out the game time, boss fights that arbitarily can only be hurt by explosions with magical infinite ammo reserves somehow implemented to keep you going...\nFor all of the callbacks, mythology gags, and attempts to appeal to the Duke 3D fans, the game plays nothing like it beyond being of the same genre. There's no depth, beyond finding boosts to your Ego meter by winning minigames or doing things like photocopying your rear end (and some objects you interact with give Ego, including easy-to-miss ones, but others that might reasonably do so.. don't). You can only carry four weapons at a time plus handheld explosives, and only two if you toggle that patched-in option off. Things like the Beer power-up are completely useless and outright detrimental. And it just keeps dragging\nand\n...\nThere is a multiplayer function to the title, make no mistake. It's fast-paced, much more so than the actual campaign mode of the game, and there's even a basic unlock and customization system. .. if unlocking aesthetics around a penthouse is your idea of a worthy set of unlocks, or being able to change Duke's shirt color, try on different glasses and put on hats is your idea of fun customization. At times the multiplayer's a bit\nhectic, though, making it rather hard to keep up with and a likely cycle of 'die, respawn, die' with larger player counts. I don't have much to say, since this is basically Call of Duty meets Quake without any real polish.\nIf this were just another crummy modern first-person-shooter, no one would've given it the time of day. But because it's Duke Nukem and been in the making for twelve years, it's not even a case of expectations being too high; I went in with middling to low expectations even at launch, and this game was so medicore, so boring, so\nthat despite getting to the last portions of the game, I just don't feel like I'll ever properly finish this game.

Due to this fact, many of the original ideas planned for the game didn't make it to the final product as can be seen in its many trailers.\nBut then, when all hope was lost (with 3D Realms closing) Gearbox appeared and saved the day buying the Duke Nukem license. And then the game was released. Was it groundbreaking? No. Was it awesome? I wish... Was it bad? No, and that's what it's important.\nIf you don't know the history of its development, the final product (at least the bulk of it, not counting the makeup and multiplayer Gearbox added later) was finished by 2009, and due to budget and legal problems, the game felt a little old even for that time. So probably most of its ideas were nice and new for 2005 maybe, its not bad! But not as impactating as they wish they were (if they decided to change it, it probably would have never been released).\nPlot wise, it isn't something jaw dropping, it is something you would expect from a Duke Nukem game: Duke is loved and desired by the women, men admire him, and kids want to be like him, it's all going well until an alien mothership comes to Earth. The problem is, they're not being hostile... yet. As the story unfolds (doesn't take too long actually) everybody finds out that the aliens plan on abducting the women, and kill everyone else, ESPECIALLY Duke Nukem, so it's up to the King to go rescue the babes and save the world once again.\nGraphically, it isn't outstanding by any means, but Gearbox did a really good job poilishing it, the blur and depth of filed effects are really well implemented. You can notice a few low res texture here and there (most noticeable on the console versions) but it shines at times like in the Cycloid Emperor fight at the start of the game or in the Mothership battle a bit alter on. What really is kinda of ugly, it's the animations, the characters move unnaturally and don't have many facial expressions, reminded of Quake 4 NPCs. On the other hand, the enemies are very detailed and in general really well done.\nIn the Sound department, it lacks a more compelling soundtrack, but the voice acting is really well done, Jon St. John returns as Duke doing a really great job. The other NPCs sound a little ridiculous sometimes, but that's intended. The one-liners return and (fortunately for me and unfortunately for others) the old ones come back too. There aren't many good ones within the introduced in this game, but some really have the spirit of the franchise.\nGameplay was one of the most controversial things about this game, I thought it was too linear run and gun with regenerative health (ego) as most FPS games are nowadays, and that's what disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to play, but I expected it to be more open ended like Duke 3D. I was hoping for something that would really differ (in a good way) from all the games we have today. There are puzzles here and there and I enjoyed them, to reduce the pace a little to not get too repetitive. The other games references were funny and not offensive like most people think they were, Duke Nukem 3D featured a \"dead space marine..\" (Duke's voice) and played just like it, guys at Id found it hilarious and not offensive, it's more of a homage than an offense. The guns for the most part don't feel very powerful (with the exception of the shotgun), and the classic funny ones can't be used as they were in Duke 3D because of the 2 weapon limit (4 as an option with a later released patch), the Shrink Ray is overpowered, since it's almost One Shot One Kill, but the Freeze-Ray is underpowered because it takes a lot of time to actually freeze the enemy and puts you in harm's way since it only works in close range.\nThe loading times aren't as huge on the PC as they are on the console versions, but it is still a little big when you are dying constantly in a specific part of the game. You can't save whenever you want, instead the game uses checkpoints, which actually makes the game more challenging (too much at times but oh well).\nMultiplayer is old school. Features deathmatch, team deathmatch, CTF (CT Babe in this case), and King of The Hill. All old school fast paced, not many people play it, but its fun for a while. Weird that when any player dies, they blow up instead of having ragdolls, probably because the guys at Gearbox didn't have time to implement it.\nAs a game released these days, I'll give it a 6, which is fair, it shares a lot of similarities to other popular FPS games these days (including the complaints). But knowing that it was supposed to be released a long time ago (talking of the actual build, not the old ones), when the ideas were actually \"new\" for the time, I would give it a 7.8.

Rather than allowing puzzles to function as a break from action, it interrupts them for more tedious \"here's two enemies, now here's two more, rinse, lather and repeat\" action. The \"execution to restore life\" idea never pays off because the player never knows if they'll actually get to perform an execution unless they get the freeze weapon... And though they finally included an option to increase the stupid two-weapon limit to four, the player is still going to end up mostly using the weapons that ammo is actually provided for on a given level. The \"interactive\" elements, like pinball tables and computers, mostly serve to try to distract from the obvious narrow linearity of the levels (and fail to do so). The humor is flat and off-putting, drawing an irate \"you thought I would laugh at THAT?\" from the player. The use of ugly green dark-vision through much of the game suggests a lack of confidence in the work of the texture artists. And perhaps worst of all for those who fondly remember Duke Nukem 3D, this iteration of Duke is a wuss... Drunk on one beer, constantly having to run for cover in every encounter, and departing more than one major fight flat on his back and passing out. I understand why some people might feel compelled to bear witness to the train wreck when the game is available at a sale price, but honestly... Spare yourself the time and go watch some of the video reviews of DNF online instead; there's probably a lot more genuine entertainment value to be found there.", "hours": 15.4, "user_id": "76561197975017173", "username": "warlock1", "products": 237, "early_access": false},

No offense to anyone, but I personally think that games like Halo and Call of Duty can NEVER live up to this degree of awesome!\nUnlike most FPS games of today, DNF strives to be original and interesting.

Sure the storyline is simple, the graphics are outdated, and the game is slightly perverted, but everyone seems to have forgotten one crucial fact, THIS IS DUKE NUKEM! and when you play a DN game you're not out to embark on a emotional, heart-wrenching, sad storyline that ends with all of your friends and you dying (MASS EFFECT 3). Nor are you out to learn about the philosophy of the human mind (BIOSHOCK). You play a DN game to KICK @$$!

All of that is well and good, but sometimes you have to throw all of that out the window and just relax and have fun (AND NOT PLAY AS SOME BORING FACELESS CHARACTER!).\nI really don't know what people wanted from this game, but I personally think that it is the best FPS game I have played all year!

Well, give it a try, and instead of looking for the \"bad\" things on the game, take a good ride with a monster truck, dismember someone with the shotgun, melee kill someone and kick all the alien asses on the way.

{"product_id": "57900", "page": 295, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2013-12-30", "text": " Duke Nukem Forever is a 2011 first-person shooter video game for Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 developed by 3D Realms and Triptych Games and finished by Gearbox Software and Piranha Games. It is a sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, as part of the long-running Duke Nukem video game series.\nIntended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever became a notable example of vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule; the game was released in 2011 after fifteen years of development.\nPlot\nTwelve years after the events of Duke Nukem 3D. Duke is a worldwide icon, and has achieved great fame from his heroic deeds. After sampling a video game based on his past heroics, he arrives on the set of a talk show for an interview. On his way to the show, Duke witnesses a news broadcast announcing that aliens have once again invaded. Unlike previous encounters, the aliens initially appear peaceful and at first seem to pose no harm to the humans of Earth. Duke's talk show appearance is cancelled to allow television stations to cover the alien invasion, and he retires to the \"Duke Cave\".\nThere, he receives a call from the President and General Graves of the Earth Defence Force . The president orders him not to harm the invaders, and adds that he is in diplomatic talks with the alien overlord. Duke obliges this request, but remains uneasy about the whole situation. Before he can leave his chambers, he is attacked by hostile aliens. Duke is forced to disobey the president's orders and fight his way through the alien hordes in an effort to save Earth. Whilst fighting through his casino, Duke witnesses the aliens abducting women including his two live-in pop star girlfriends. Graves tells Duke that the women are being held in the Duke Dome, and that the aliens have a vendetta to settle with Duke. He also warns Duke that the aliens are using the Hoover Dam to power a wormhole so more aliens can come through. Nukem travels to the Duke Dome, using a wrecking ball to damage the building to gain access. Inside, he finds swarms of Octabrains and the missing women, who have been impregnated with alien spawn; Duke's girlfriends die after giving \"birth\" to alien babies. Duke finds the Alien Queen in control of the Dome and kills her, but is wounded in the process and blacks out.\nAfter regaining consciousness, Duke fights Pigcops and aliens in through the Duke Burger. Soon he travels to the Hoover Dam in his monster truck; after battling through the dam, he finds his old friend Dylan, mortally wounded. He tells Duke that the Cycloid Emperor is at the dam, and that the only way to shut down the portal is to completely destroy the dam. Before dying, he gives Duke his demolition charges and wishes him luck. Duke places the explosives and destroys the dam, but the currents nearly drown him. Duke is revived by an EDF soldier; he awakens to find the portal gone. The President, who was also at the dam, rages at Duke for ruining his plans to work with the Cycloid Emperor and that he has ordered a nuclear strike at the site of the dam to wipe out the remaining aliens, intending to leave Duke there to die. The Cycloid Emperor emerges and kills the President and his security detail. Duke kills the Cycloid Emperor and is rescued by Graves just as the nuclear bomb explodes.\nThe game ends with a satellite surveying the detonation area and listing Duke Nukem as killed in action, to which Duke replies off-screen, \"What kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ending is that? I ain't dead. I'm coming back for more!\" A short scene after the ending credits depicts a press conference, where Duke announces his intent to run for the President of the United States.\nGameplay\nDuke Nukem Forever is an action-oriented first-person shooter. Players take control of Nukem as they navigate through a series of levels which take place on Earth and beyond. The game allows players to interact with various in-game objects, including urinals, water coolers and whiteboards which allow players to draw their own images. The gameplay is similar in some respects to the first-person shooter games of the late 1990s and early 2000s, with each level culminating in a boss battle in which Nukem has to fight and kill a large, significant alien.\nUnlike in the previous games, Duke can only hold two weapons at any one time in a manner similar to the Halo series, although pipe bombs and laser tripwires are considered inventory items and as such are not limited by this restriction. The PC version allows Duke to hold four weapons in the single-player campaign. Items that have an effect on Duke can be picked up by the player; these items are steroids, beer, and the holoduke. Steroids increase the strength of Duke's melee attacks by a great deal for a limited time. Beer makes Duke much more resistant to damage, but blurs the screen. A holoduke creates a hologram of Duke Nukem that looks and acts in a very similar way to Duke, but often says slightly twisted versions of his one-liners. Whilst the holoduke is in effect, Duke becomes invisible and the AI characters do not recognize his presence. The jetpack also returns, but only in multiplayer.\nInstead of the health system featured in the previous Duke Nukem game, in which health would be depleted when Nukem was injured and would only increase upon finding a health pack, drinking water from fountains/broken fire hydrants, urinating or using the portable medkit special item, Duke Nukem Forever employs a system involving an \"ego bar\". The ego bar depletes when Duke is attacked; once it is fully depleted, Duke becomes susceptible to damage, dying and causing the game to reload the last checkpoint. If the player avoids further damage, then the ego bar is restored as is Duke's health. The player can increase the size of the ego bar  by interacting with certain items throughout the game, and by defeating bosses. The game employs a save system that is solely based on checkpoints.\nDevelopment\nOriginally in development under 3D Realms, director George Broussard, one of the creators of the original Duke Nukem game, first announced the title's development in April 1997, and various promotional information for the game was released between 1997 and 1998. After repeatedly announcing and deferring release dates, 3D Realms announced in 2001 that it would be released simply \"when it's done\". No official video of the game was shown for almost 8 years, until 3D Realms released a new teaser trailer in December 2007, but the game \"submerged\" yet again soon afterwards.\nIn May 2009, 3D Realms was downsized for financial reasons, resulting in the loss of the game's development team. Statements by the company indicated that the project was due to go gold soon with pictures of final development. Take-Two Interactive, which owns the publishing rights to the game, filed a lawsuit in 2009 against 3D Realms over their failure to finish development. 3D Realms retorted that Take-Two's legal interest in the game was limited to their publishing right. The case was settled with prejudice and details undisclosed in July 2010.\nOn September 3, 2010, after 14 years, Duke Nukem Forever was officially reported by 2K Games to be in development at Gearbox Software. It was originally confirmed to be released on May 3, 2011 in North America, with a worldwide release following on May 6, 2011. This was, however, delayed by a month to June 10 internationally, with a North American release on June 14.\nOn May 24, 2011, it was announced that Duke Nukem Forever finally \"went gold\" after 15 years. After going gold the launch trailer for Duke Nukem Forever was released on June 2, 2011, quelling any doubt that release was anything but imminent. On June 27, 2011, Aspyr Media announced that Duke Nukem Forever would be making its way onto Mac OS X in August 2011. It was made available for pre-order on June 27 via their online game distribution platform GameAgent.\nMarketing", "hours": 3.8, "user_id": "76561198067804188", "username": "Nick", "products": 279, "early_access": false},

However, I found it entertaining and I was compelled to finish it and even go after quite a few of its achievements. There were quite a few fun moments and some good jokes. I will, however, point out that this game, unlike Shadow Warrior's execution of a 90s-styled-shooter, often missed the mark and did a multitude of things terribly wrong. What could have been its biggest strengths come off as its biggest weaknesses. For instance, in the 90s, you would have 8-10 guns at any time, whereas modern games usually go for a realistic 2-3 at most, but that's mostly because the guns are so similar in modern games...such as different assault rifles or different shotguns and such. However, when your game has shrink rays, freeze rays, and other such fun guns, the game needs more weapon slots. At launch, you could only have two weapons on Duke at a time, though I've read that the number has increased to four with a patch. This still isn't really enough in my opinion.\nSo that's how the game fell short on the retro side of things. As for its modern shortcomings, the technology for quality NPCs, storyline, interesting events, etc. exist, but almost all of these are quite poor and forgettable in this game. But I digress...for all the game's shortcomings, it's still pretty fun, though the multiplayer is typical fare and a bit of a ghost town. Only buy this if you're bored and curious.

Years later down the line, Duke Nukem 3D, the game we all know and love, was set out onto PCs, with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, a ton of explosions, and a direct competitor to the ever-famous Doom.\nWhile not as successful as Doom was, Duke 3D revolutionized the way a game was designed, with an emphasis on exploring your environments, multiple level paths, and a lot of pop-culture references, specifically to the Evil Dead series of films. Duke Nukem 3D was, itself, an odd one in the bunch, just like Forever is the odd one in the regenerating health, pushing your skull into the middle of the screen, level-up, gray mess of modern games.\nForever is a simple game, that actually has a lot more for it than meets the eye. Initially, I played the whole game in a few days, and was not even disappointed. The humor, the action, the exploration (although limited) was there, and I ultimately walked away from my computer, satisfied, smiling, and nodding to myself, \"I'm going to end up playing this a few more times in the future, I know it...\"\nYes, it's buggy. Yes, it's weird. Yes, it's catering towards the modern generation of gamers with the limited items, linear paths, and regenerating health - but - as a whole, Forever really is a good and fun gaming experience, because isn't that what a game is INTENDED TO DO: make you have fun? Remember a time when a game was fun, and you didn't have to shove eight different filters of gray and blue on a game, focus about 70% of it to cut-scenes and quick-time events, and were able to finish it by using your wits and cunning - surveying the landscape for health pickups, ammo, and routes around enemies and puzzles? I do... and so should you.\nDrop that 60$ right now, modern, hipster, Skrillex-listening, Minecraft-loving, indie-pushing gamer - and that copy of Call of Duty: Ghosts of a Dead Series - and put it into getting Duke Nukem 3D, 1, 2, and Forever - and spend your leftovers on something to drink and munch - you're going to sit down and enjoy a game for what it is: fun.\n-\nK12machinima - Seth", "hours": 5.8, "user_id": "76561198027750252", "username": "K12machinima", "products": 176, "early_access": false},

(And also for those who just want to know what DNF is really like)\nFirst off: Duke Nukem Forever HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT for 12 years, but that does not mean Gearbox has been developing it for 12 years. Got that? Good, let's go.\n1. For the Graphics Players:\nThe game is not Crysis. It's not Far Cry 2. It's not even CoD. So, if this is what you base a game on, then don't even bother. DNF is more Serious Sam HD meets HL2 in my opinion. Some textures look awesome, some look really old. Overall, IMO, it's acceptable. I like eye-candy, make no mistake, but this is not what DNF is about. It never was, nor will it ever be.\n2. The Profanity, Toilet Humour:\nDuke is a dirty SOB. It's been like that ever since he first got voice. It will always be like that. It's part of the Duke Nukem \"thing\". It's even rated for it. Expect cursing, expect spending 20 minutes throwing poop around and jarateing on ♥♥♥♥. It's how it is. Get over it.\n3. Gameplay:\nThis is where I have a serious issue with the game. So, I have broken it up into parts:\n3.1 Linear Gameplay\nThis is my first problem with the game. WTF Gearbox? All DN3D maps were never linear. Sometimes you had to backtrack your way. There were also several ways to get to an objective. From what I have seen so far, there is only one way to get to your current objective and this totally ruins it for me. TotalBiscuit has a video which you can watch of the first 45 minutes of the game, be careful, it might contain spoilers.\n3.2 Scripted Events\nAlthough all games have scipted events, there're few things that jarate me off more than a developer who forces you to watch or listen to them. Gearbox will actually block your path so you HAVE to wait for the scripted event to finish. Because it's a linear game, there's obviously no way to skip the event.\n3.3 Only 2 Weapons\nDN3D and all older FPS games allowed the player to carry all the weapons with the player. At the start of the game, the load screen says: \"Duke Nukem can bench-press 600 pounds\". Yet, he is unable to carry more than two weapons...\n4. Mouse Smoothing\nYou can scale it down, but you cannot disable it completely. I assume that once we actually delve into the config files, we should be able to. Although, this should be doable in the optons menu.\n5. Regenerating Health\nThanks JoeB for reminding me about this. Regenerating health isn't really such a big deal to me, although, it's way off the bat when it comes to Duke Nukem. We're used to health packs to bring our health back up. The game did amuse me with it's own \"health packs\" though. To regain health, you need to boost your ego. There are several ways to do it in the game. My favourite is admiring yourself in the mirror. This really gave me a laugh. I really think that's one of the game's true Duke Nukem elements. Duke is a narcissist and you get to be one in game.\n6. Saving the Game\nKudos lagrenouille for bringing this to my attention. You also can't quicksave in the game. Or save for that matter. The game is based on checkpoints. Yes, isn't that meant for consoles?\n7. FOV (Field of View)\nSomething has been bugging me and I couldn't put my finger on it until just now. The FOV is really annoying. I believe it to be around 70-75. I think 90-100 would make this better. Probably easy to change in the config files, although I haven't checked yet and just couldn't be bothered to be honest.\nFor now, this is what I have experienced. Not to happy about it and I hope Gearbox actually listens to the community and undo the f-up that they have caused in the game.\nOverall, I think this game is not too bad.

It is an oldskool shooter that will remind us that was gaming in the 90's of a simpler time. When you dident need a gripping story about how everything was terrible and serious, you just wanted to have some fun!\nAnd fun it is, from the very start where you can walk around your palace like appartment and interact with the environment to the over the top action scenes with monsters big as houses eating your RPG one rocket at a time. The nudiebar is one of my favorite places since it gives you a break from the normal gameplay and lets you interact with stuff in the world. Beeing able to flush a toilet or use a pool table is such a throwback to the good old games before Call of Battle: Russia must die!\nBut ofcourse there are faults with the game. You can notice that there have been lots and lots of different people working on this over a long period of time. The vechicle parts of the game are terrible and the turret sections makes me want to point the gun at myself instead.

More because the expectations of it was higher than the actual game.  I spent more time on this game than any other game so far on steam.  Used to play it a lot and run a dedicated server but haven't really spent much time on it in a long time.  It's not the best game on steam but it doesn't suck either.  I really enjoyed playing the single player campaign and the DLC.  Played a lot of Duke Nukem back in the 90's and this game is what brought me back into PC gaming after not gaming for a long time.  I think the graphics are decent.  Not exactly anything realistic and jaw dropping like Crysis 3 but still not bad.\nThe multi-player is what I spent the most time on.  It was an absolute blast for about a year after it came out.  You have to run your rear off pretty much non-stop.  It's easy to kill and be killed.  Weapons are pretty powerful and it's common to score a fast kill.  Getting all the achievements in the game takes \"FOREVER\" and to get them done within your lifetime takes friends helping you get them.  The multi-player is extremely solid except the main problem is lag and at times a ton of it.  So much so people can kill you before your gun can even touch them.  If you host or have really low ping you for sure have a big advantage over players who don't.  Try hosting and see what a difference it makes.  Unfortunately, this fun game got taken over by some hackers and/or people with such massive egos that it ruins it for most others.  Now it's only fun playing with friends.

The environments and enemies look well enough, certainly not cutting edge but well past the limits of the sixth generation. There's even a small bit of platforming and puzzle solving, such as the remote control cars, running around in miniature, and bouncing inside an alien mother ship. There's lots of items strewn about with which the player can interact, like a fully functioning pinball machine, and boss fights usually depend on some gimmick instead of firepower.\nUnfortunately, none of these distractions are fully realized or satisfying, and only serve to interrupt very claustrophobic gun-play through narrow hallways and trenches. There a plenty of scripted set-pieces that reinforce this sense of linearity, creating spectacle at the expense of freedom, like being lifted by a crane or manning a turret against enemy spacecraft. I enjoy linear games, but the level design here did little to excite me.\nThe other big strike against this game is its personality. For instance, in Duke Nukem 3D, the titular protagonist was fairly quiet except for the occasional musing. Forever is packed with quips, but without any restraint or comedic timing. Lines like \"I've got balls of fail\" or \"Strange silicon-based life form\" wear out their welcome immediately, and the title is full of such groaners.\nOther stabs at humor and shock value are more questionable. When playing through an organic alien lair, the walls are decorated with disembodied breasts. Here, the player finds abductees who have been implicitly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and thus impregnated with enemy fetuses. The player may either euthanize these women or allow said monsters to incubate. While I can appreciate the \"No-win\" scenario, the whole scene felt extremely sadistic and underscores the problems with the game's mean-spirited attitude. I didn't buy Duke Nukem Forever to watch women suffer, and after having experienced that I generally feel worse as a person.\nBetween tedious game-play and troubling jokes, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. It's a functional if not boring game stymied by what I consider to be poor taste.

The weapons feel good and are great fun to utilize to smash through your enemies. The story makes no attempts to be anything serious either, it's just Duke being Duke and everyone who disagrees with Duke is wrong. That's it. It's a fun campy game - for the first couple hours.\nBy the time you reach the desert and the Hoover Dam after that, the game loses its color and becomes highly repetitive and frankly a chore to play through. Weapons are fun to use until you realize you can only use two (or if you enabled an option, four) at a time and eventually it just stops giving you anything new to play with. By the time you've finished you're relieved to be done, and then you play the DLC chapter. The DLC feels more like what Duke Nukem Forever probably should have been, a short story rather than an \"epic\" and plays better than most of the main game did.\nDuke has unfortunately outstayed his welcome, which should surprise frankly no one.

Because there were no other shooters. So playing the first ever 3d shooter while constantly sprinting and blasting at warhogs while carrying tons of weapons as well as having an occasional laugh at what the Duke or his enemies were doing was a blast.\nBut on the other hand, how do you make an FPS interesting wherein you simply mow down rows of enemies? I don't know, Serious Sam did it and that game had co-op. Bulletstorm did it. To tell you the truth, when I was watching the gameplay trailers I was trying not to think: \"what? that's IT?\" because for some reason I was believing that there was something more to the gameplay and the game itself that was being kept secret, some spice. That was denial at its best. The game turned out to be a mix of Quake 1, Serious Sam (minuses various and funny enemies), some random kindergarten puzzles thrown in the mix and.....that's pretty much it. And sorry devs, Duke's supposedly hilarious quotes and outburst just don't cut it. Sure, there are some non-cliche moments in the game but they usually last a couple of seconds.\nHowever, at least you can only carry a couple of guns at the time, which is supposed to add more realism - if only that was not overshadowed by so many other things. For instance the AI is either charging at you or simply standing still and shooting you from afar (think Killzone 2,3 and how smart your enemies were, the smartest AI in all gaming in fact). The driving stages are okaish, except you are always confined to carefully crafted small areas that are either canyons or areas blocked off by garbage and other nonsense. The Big boss battles are the same: keep on moving, shooting, collect ammo drops, keep running in circles and the enemy won't hit you. No tactics required.\nThe aliens of course are kidnapping the white blonde hot-bodied chicks only. No other ethnicity apparently exists on Earth at the time. The whole sexism and overt insecure alpha male heterosexuality shows with almost each one of Duke's outbursts, but I guess there just has to be one game that has its own niche to fill. So I can't comment to negatively on this, I'm just glad that it's only one game that does this sort of thing.\nSome things I can't complain about however. You actually CAN see your legs and you DO cast a shadow and you DO have a voice, and what a voice that is! if only all shooters had those extra three things I usually ask for. But in this case, this rare treat is absolutely wasted on this horribly pretentious game.\nI bet that new Serious Sam (which only took a few years to develop, I reckon) is going to have a similar run'n'shoot hordes of enemies premise, however I think it's going to be pulled off better than this Puke.\nUltimately, most of us have grown and matured since 1998, some of us didn't. Some jokes aren't as funny anymore. If this game were released the mere years after the last game, then the similar age-minded audience would clap in awe. I understand the whole old-school nostalgia thing which CAN be delivered with so many recent 2-D platform remakes of the old NES classics. However this game is not a re-make nor does it feel like Duke Nukem part 4 or 5 or whatever. I'm not sure if this is a re-boot either because I doubt any more Duke will be made.\nRest in Peace, Duke.

The gameplay was pretty good with some issues pulling it down at times (see below).\nThe Bad: Some of the pacing for the game could have been adjusted. I could have stood for some more variety in baddies. I'm not sure about their choice of only being able to have 2 guns at a time.

The story is terrible but then again, it's Duke Nukem; were you really expecting Metal Gear Solid quality story telling? The game's only saving grace is Duke Nukem himself. He's a loveable character even in these tough times. Spewing out silly one liners and owning a business empire centered around himself has made him even cooler.Jon St. John returns once again to play the voice of Duke and as always does an amazing job at portraying him.

This Duke leans on stamina bars, regenerating health, limited weapon slots, scripted events and linear maps.\nInstead of the sprawling maps of Duke 3D, that had you running, jumping, flying and swimming all over the place, looking for secrets and keycards you play through entirely linear and fully scripted sequences and fights you do not allow you to progress until you've killed what the game wants you to kill and listened to whatever irrelevant dialog the game wants you to listen to. The entire experience is slow and dull and there is little to look forward to besides the naked ladies and the occasional proper joke.\nDuke Nukem 3D was a masterpiece of adolescent insanity, of old school fast paced shooting, of innovative map design. Duke Nukem Forever has captured the adolescent part but lost everything else in the shuffle. What's left is a mediocre shooter with a bunch of nudes thrown around.\nDuke Nukem Forever is not a very good game. It's a game that doesn't stay true to it's old school roots doesn't even compare to the original. Even by modern standards it brings nothing new to the table, just a bunch of rehashed concepts and ideas. Nothing is new, nothing is better than what's been already done.\nAll in all. For those that have been waiting, hoping for a good old school style shooter, this ain't it. And for those that just want a decent modern shooter to pass the time, this ain't it either. They might get the crude humor right but everything else, just ain't Duke.", "hours": 162.4, "username": "c00lizz", "products": 2215, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false},

That is me trying to be as objective as possible. The game was in development for years and drove it's parent company 3D Realms completely out of business. I followed it like a hawk and was extremely disappointed with what little Gearbox did to it.\nDuke Nukem Forever has a lot of flaws and many people incorrectly assume it's because \"Duke Nukem is outdated\". Infact if this game had been a Serious Sam style old school first person shooter, I would be defending it til the day I die. That is not what this game is at all. It has all the outdated elements of Duke Nukem 3D along with a lot of modern concessions. While the game does implement new elements to the design they tend to fall flat. You have new weapons you don't use, new quotes you don't enjoy and new elements you dislike. What we get is regenerating health, and a two weapon limit. Yes Duke needs to hide behind cover and stop feeling depressed when he gets shot.\nThe game is certainly not unplayable, fully patched it runs at a stable framerate with FOV options. Since it's an U3 game it generally shouldn't have too many bugs. It's just not the game we wanted and that's what utterly kills me with it. It doesn't appeal to new players and it alienates old ones.\nI actually feel the one thing Gearbox could have done to fix all this was to add modding support to the game. Duke Nukem 3D had a very large map editing community that still survives to this day.

Where do I even start with this game?\nOkay, I'll start with the most important part: The graphics. The graphics in this game are downright delirious. You will not believe that this is a videogame. You will think you are IN the game, shooting aliens and women. It's incredibly realistic, and everything from the TT-BLWs (Tactical Turd-Based Lobbed Weaponry) to the FMRs (Funny Meme References) are rendered in amazing detail.\nThe gameplay is in a class of its own. Not only is there a spectacular amount of quirky and interesting weaponry available to you, you can even carry more than one of them at once, allowing previously unseen levels of tactical depth as you can choose which weapon to use, depending on the situation. Do you use the pistol, or the shotgun? This is a game that really forces you to make some decisions.\nThe plot is amazing. Without spoiling too much, I will say that you're going to see some incredible character development - the Duke really matures as a person over the course of the game, and it deals with emotionally complex issues, like love, loss, and shooting women. Who said that games can't be art?\nThe audio design is top of the line. Kickin' guitar riffs mesh and mingle with Nukem's classic, ever-original one-liners such as \"Hail to the King, baby!\" and \"Looks like you're ♥♥♥♥ed!\". The excellent voice acting is only improved by the impressive quality of the script. There will be laughs aplenty as you shoot aliens, go to strip clubs, and - if you're lucky - maybe even get to visit the Secret Level.\nAll in all, I can safely recommend this game to anyone. Even people who aren't gamers. Hell, I can even recommend it to CASUAL \"gamers\", that's how marvellous this gem is.

From the aspect of \"modern gamers\" it's not even worth the \"mediocre game\" title since the gameplay and the story gets a tiny bit of repetitive and boring after the half of the game. Seriously though I really expected some extra twists after I reached that crucial part of the storyline yet nothing happened. It has some nice ideas and many one-liners (some of them are painfully dumb, it's like I'm listening to some 8 year old through a Skype chat. XD). I can't blame the devs for it since it's clear that this game does not belong to this \"gaming era\". It's a relic from a long passed age where FPS games meant nothing, but mindless shooting with some little extra platforming sequences, but there is one really odd thing about this statement. The character of Serious Sam is an almost completely direct rip-off of Duke Nukem yet Sam works perfectly in parts where Duke fails gloriously.\nOne: One-liners': Duke is nowhere as near entertaining as Sam is. His one-liners are following one simple rule \"Say♥♥♥♥♥♥ no matter what.\" Most of the time he isn't even trying to be funny, just \"♥♥♥♥ing around\" like a kid who has just learned a few bad words and is eager to try them out on something.\nTwo: Enemies: I'm not completely sure about this one, but as I played the game, nothing seemed to explain the origins of these aliens, we don't know any of their plans it seems like that the main reason of their revenge is just to♥♥♥♥♥♥Duke off.\n\"Sam\" howewer has a Seriously detailed background \"database\" for all of the available enemies, the storyline, even for the weapons and for the levels themselves!\nThese short arguments may not be valid for a long time DN fan, but the only thing I'm trying to point here is that the \"imitation\" of Duke surpassed it's own \"master\" which is pretty hilarious considering all those references in Sam games and the development time of DNF.\nAs my final words regarding this game: A gem/ghost from the past which will only be enjoyed by old gamers.

What it is is a fun shooter with plenty of throwbacks and references to the 90's/early 2000's. It's not without its flaws, but it is plenty of fun and worthy of a collection, especially for a tenner.\nGraphics- No, they aren't great. No, they don't push the limits of anything beyond a low-midrange computer. But they get the job done and do look good while doing so. Pigcops, certain cars, certain weapons, octabrains, and bosses are modeled very well, and you can definitely tell what they are and what they were modeled after (meaning you'll recognize a battlelord right away if you've played Duke3D). Plus, since this game doesn't push high-end setups, it's accessible to everyone.\nSound- Not much to speak of here. The sound is done well. Guns have enough punch. Music is done well. Stereo separation and directional audio does what it needs to.\nGameplay- Honestly, this is where it matters most. You do buy a game for gameplay, not to just look at graphics. Again, don't expect this to rule the gaming world with fresh, innovative play. But, if you're looking for a shooter that's fast, precise, and doesn't do much of the cover mechanic, this is it. Plenty of stuff to shoot, plenty of guns to use, plenty of bosses to fight and die against.\nOverall, good for several playthroughs and some multiplayer.

You got to explore the map to find secrets to keep yourself better equipped and encounter various fun intractable objects. Now, imagine that game with none of that. Mostly.\nWhile some of the guns are fun to shoot, because you're limited to 2 weapons (or 4 if you choose \"extended inventory\", which was added after the game release), you don't get to carry around all of them which makes it the worst part of the game. Bosses pretty much require you to carry an RPG, so you’re limited to one weapon most of the times. This game would have been a lot more fun if you could carry all of the weapons just like the classic games.\nThey added first person platforming which is awkward, but at least it didn't make the game unnecessarily harder to beat. There are occasionally puzzles, but uninspired and mostly easy.\nDodging enemy projectiles and attacks while blasting your way out was a fun part of the original Duke Nukem games, but that is also gone here. Enemies shoot fast (unless they carry heavy weapons) and lock on you, you cannot perform any advanced maneuvers, especially when the maps have so many objects you can run into and most of the battle areas are very condensed.\nThis game fails to deliver that original Duke Nukem experience and made something that no one really wanted. It’s a bad shooter, but it’s really a good one either. To be fair, it wasn't boring at least, but then again why your precious life waste time on such a mediocre game? There are so many other options if you want to play some kickass mindless shooter (e.g. Serious Sam 3), this game is NOT RECOMMENDED, even for a cheap price.", "hours": 38.4, "username": "Sherry", "products": 2552, "early_access": false},

And then nothing but 15 years of promises and maybes hinted by leaked screenshots.  Fast forward to Duke Nukem Forever and the results are wildly mixed. Positives are the gunplay, voice acting, crude humor and boss fights. Negatives include the platforming elements, BEYOND uneven level design and atrocious load times. The level design was so frustrating. For every clever and fun level like Lady Killer or Ghost Town, they'd throw in a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥like The Hive.  Even the levels taking place outside of Vegas were meh. And the platforming elements. Horrible. Special shout out to Duke Burger Part 2 which irritated the hell out of me. Platforming elements are fine but I found the controls to be a little floaty where Duke would take that extra unintended step and you are back to the last checkpoint.  And the load times, my lord the load times. I died quite a bit in this game as in my old age the reflexes don't work like they used to but I can probably recite every tip that came on during the laod screens.

As a result, when I first decided to play Duke Nukem Forever (a game which was released 20 years after Castlevania IV) I expected to see the same innovative ideas. To my shock (and horror) I discovered that Duke Nukem Forever does not feature 8 directional-whips, in fact, Duke Nukem Forever doesn't have whips at all! This was most disappointing because I was really looking forward to whipping in 16 different directions but maybe 20 years isn't enough to create digital whips that whip in that many directions.\nWhereas Castlevania IV has the player advance through various themed (and spooky) stages until you arrive at Dracula's Lair and defeat him in a climactic end to the only good Castlevania game, Duke Nukem Forever has you save American pornstars from Kotaku writers. Personally I think that saving the world from Dracula is more important than saving American pornstars but I am not a cis-gendered feminist so what do I know.\nIn conclusion I would recommend Super Duke Nukem IV over Castlevania Forever because there are a lot of innuendos and sexual jokes about ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and those are my favourite types of jokes.", "hours": 3.5, "username": "Suave", "products": 392, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

I found this installment to be a little different from the previous ones but with the technology changes over the insanely long devolopment period of this game, it is fair to say the game will be different. I will say I have a few complaints myself but I enjoyed the game overall. I am glad to see that the game did not receive a large number of DLC to seem like it was a money pit. I thought that the Doctor Who Cloned Me to be rather fitting for the game and it was worth the price I got it for. Okay, back to the base game. The graphics are much better from any previous installments and are pretty impressive for the time of its inception. The UI and AI are fully functional and it provides a challenge but definitely possible. The level design is fairly linear but sometimes allows other approach options and the environment in each level is finely made into a very believable scenario. The control and overall functionality of the game is solid as well as sticking to realistic arsenal choice. Allowing you to carry only two weapons or four if you allow it in the options, you are deciding what weapon is best for each encounter or just to fit your preference. Also, the EGO system makes it similar to Halo's shield system or anything like it. I like that they decided to do something different but I think the old formula of medkits and armor is sufficient. Also, the arsenal is not to far from your arsenal in Duke Nukem 3D but that is not bad. The weapons that are new are the Expander and the Impregnator Gun. Also, the Freeze Ray can't shoot projectiles but only a continuous beam that recharges. Then the Shrink Ray is not a weapon but a story component that changes the combat somewhat since you will be very small. Well, to conclude, I thought this game was a success and I found it very enjoyable and well thought out.

Who was this game for? Duke Nukem fans. But even they are deterred by the poor choices that designers made. Some of this stuff is even too immature for Duke Nukem. A lot makes sense, like the beginning, sort of. But then you get things like punching aliens in sensitive bits Duke assumes they have, or picking up a turd and throwing it around. Yes, we were able to urinate in Duke Nukem 3D, but that doesn't mean there needs to be more bathroom jokes, or nut-punching. I like the fourth wall breaking, I liked kicking a cyclops eye through a field goal post, I liked the finishers of kicking enemies in the head, or increasing my ego with minigames or looking at myself in the mirror, because Duke will be Duke.\nThis game has your standard Duke story; Duke gets mad at aliens for stealing his favorite girls, Duke sets out on revenge mission, President hates Duke, Duke flips off aliens AND President, Duke swears and does immature things, fun shooting, fun shooting, fun shooting, minigames, minigames, minigames, and so on and so forth.\nBut this game makes me think that Duke's time has come to and end. In the late 90s, it was like Duke ruled, but his reign quickly ended with an array of crappy games and this one is no different. Duke has one good game, and unless some serious changes are made, that's all there will be.\nI do have one idea for the future of Duke: A game about him getting older and him going in search of a son he didn't know he had, his son is the antagonist, mad at Duke for killing who he thought was his father, but Duke is his father. This gives you all those opportunities for movie references, bad jokes, but having a new experience with new enemies, a new antagonist, and a plot-twist. This would even make it so Duke's son becomes the protagonist in a sequel that could possibly be funded if the game really does change Duke. Possibly even a 2-player co-op sequel where one player is Duke, and the other is...  you guessed it... LUKE. That's right, you'd hear \"Duke. You killed my father.\" \"No. I am your father.\" \"That's not true! That's impossible!\"\nAnyways, onto PROS and CONS:\n+ References to previous games\n+ Reference to the long wait for this game\n+ Ego instead of health\n+ Ego boosts\n+ Items you can use to change the tide of combat\n+ Classic strafe and shoot combat\n+ 80s movie references\n+ Duke is back\n- Duke is back\n- Disappointing after the long wait\n- 80s movie references may be too dated, now\n- Unreal Engine is not used to its potential\n- 2-weapon carry limit\n- Humor that's just immature and not smart or funny\n- Same aliens, less interesting experience\n- Physics glitches\n- Standard Duke story\n- Some really frustrating mini-games\n- What's with the low decal count?

In other words, it's bad. Read on at your own risk.\nIt's even more puerile than\n, and with even less relevance. When 3D came out in early '96, at least that game's aesthetic was an earnest step in a new direction: video gaming entering its adolescence. It may not have been particularly tasteful or mature, but at least it was a better direction than the cynical, even-more-outrageous toxic masculinity and objectification of women on display here.\nThe developers at one point said their world-building was genius because everyone in-universe takes it completely seriously. It more often comes across as tired, aggressively moronic, disgusting, or a combo thereof. Hamfisted, outdated references galore in a sad, unnecessary attempt to mimic what Duke once was: a parody of then-relevant action movies. In 3D, this sort of stuff, while still pretty lowbrow, ultimately played second fiddle to the great gameplay. Here, the\nseems like it plays second fiddle in both quality and importance.\nThe only plus I can give the writing is that it's an unwitting dystopia. Duke is our hero for saving the world multiple times as humanity is more vulnerable than ever. We see massive monuments erected in his honor, awards bestowed, his own fast food chain, and even a Vegas casino dedicated to him. Thanks to his hero status, normal people are emulating his forceful personality enough that American society has become more aggressive and sexist. One wonders if the world is even worth saving again.\nDNF makes its alien invasion story feel tiring quicker than it has a right to. There's a couple characters here and there, primarily Duke's friend General Graves and his boss, the less-than-perceptive US President. You'll see the plot 'twist' concerning him a mile away. Captain Dylan the infantry commander is notable for how vulgar he is. The rest are unremarkable or cannon-fodder, with two in particular I'll get to soon.\nThere are a couple inspired touches, but they're needles in a haystack. For example, whenever Duke is knocked down or kicks open a door, there's a nice sense of presence to the animation - it's satisfying to kick open doors. The dynamic, breakable lighting is also a nice touch, as is keyboard navigation in the menus ala 3D.\nThen you see another low-quality texture right out of 2004 and you remember what game you're playing. I mean, the graphics aren't the worst thing about this game by far, but they stand out pretty early as a sign of things to come. It makes DNF seem like a prolonged boxing match between the power of human talent and the ravages of time.\nThe writing reaches its nadir in the alien hive, about midway through the game. Here we have - trigger warning, folks - rather graphic depictions of sexual violence against women by the alien invaders. I know this was sort of a thing in 3D, but it wasn't nearly as graphic or tasteless. In DNF, we hear Duke cracking wise at all of it like nothing is out of the ordinary.\nYou soon come across two characters that were never more than one-dimensional parodies and servile sex objects for Duke, and this is the important part, right up to their final painful moments.\nwe come across alien boobs embedded in a wall which Duke can play with and snark about while women scream in pain and horror all around him. The most he can do is mercy-kill them while unconvincingly stating it's 'better this way'. The whole thing is, and I'm saying this with\ncharity, not the best fit for a parodic series about a manly dude blowing stuff up and obsessing over babes.\nNow, the gameplay.\nIt is largely derivative of Half-Life and Halo, but not as good. The game was dated when it came out, really. Maybe if you're a 'retro gamer' you can appreciate that, but you'll still feel the game should have came out at least 6 years before it did.\nDNF's gunplay is pretty mediocre; albeit not totally awful,  it really is more like Halo than Duke. The option to carry four weapons (because 'Duke isn't Halo!') makes the game easier at the cost of destroying what little verisimilitude it had and making it hilarious when Duke literally wishes out loud that he had three guns late in the game.\nMy favorite weapon was actually the pistol, a relatively modest weapon that rewarded accuracy. Most of the other guns felt sloppy and unsatisfying, although the shotgun deserves credit for stopping power. The aiming and movement are a little off, too. Occasionally the movement gels well with what's going on, but oftentimes it's just weird.\nI was initially surprised by how quickly I was progressing through the campaign, but there's a decent amount there - enough frustration and filler, at least. It took me around 10 hours the first time on Hard difficulty. Some of the puzzles and player directioning hint at competence on the design team, but not enough of it got through. There's enough world interactivity to match DN3D, but without the benefit of being new or unique.\nThe game's linear structure is a far cry from 3D's open levels, which would be forgivable if it was good. DNF's story may be in the background, but it's ultimately more of a driving force than 3D's. Said predecessor is masterful in comparison, building off Doom with its labryinthine levels and mostly unintrusive plot. DNF really wants to be more like\n, with linear progression supplemented by spoonfuls of \"story\" and even vehicle sections.\nThose sections aren't the\ndriving, like how a leftover $1.50 pizza bagel isn't the\nsnack. It certainly can't make up for long loading times & small level sizes comparable to Invisible War in their ridiculousness.\nI didn't entirely care for the way you increase your regenerating health (or \"ego\"). Although it becomes a blessing on harder difficulties, you still have to run away from combat to regenerate - that's hardly badass. It feels like Duke is more vulnerable and washed up than he thinks he is, whether he knows it or not; further evidence of this is that he only needs to drink ONE beer pickup at a time to get really drunk. It also gave the devs an excuse to mash Call of Duty's influence into their potpourri of a campaign, but I digress.\nOverused QTE events, mediocre turret sections, rote boss fights, annoying enemies and encounters that border on unplayably difficult round out DNF's list of features. The Grand Canyon-esque difficulty spikes in those battles indicate a lack of playtesting.\nIn fairness, the final level & boss battle was surprisingly decent. The giant Enforcer-versus-mini Duke battle was also inspired, even if you had to juke it to win. It's not worth playing the rest of the game to get to either point. Ladders meanwhile are probably the most interesting thing in the entire game: you press a key to get on and you actually\nthe things. It sacrifices juking potential for actual ease of use.\nMultiplayer is decidedly old-school yet not done well enough to be considered retro, with a small population of diehards still playing. The starting pistol at least proved powerful enough that I didn't die\nthe time to the weird hit detection, because the weird hit detection also worked in my favor. The My Digs feature might have been interesting if it wasn't partly sexist and if the game was good enough to play and unlock stuff.\nDNF is a big disappointment if your expectations are anywhere above the level of 'budget shooter'. Duke was a product of a specific time, a vehicle that didn't need to be revived so acrimoniously to create what is essentially a parody of action blockbusters by way of Adam Sandler.

(This is the campaign I'm talking about) Who the hell said it would be a good idea for dumb♥♥♥♥♥turret sections and monster truck rally to be in Duke Forever??\nHonestly, I want to defend this game because I'm a die hard fan of Duke Nukem, but I just can't give DNF the love it deserves. (Do make note of my time played on this game) Duke Forever's campaign simply goes like this: Duke get's♥♥♥♥♥♥sucked, aliens come down for coffee/scones, Duke ready to kill, Duke has no jetpack/must use elevator, aliens go pew pew pew, Duke go pew pew pew, Duke smacks♥♥♥♥♥♥on wall, Duke smacks♥♥♥♥♥♥on girl, Duke shoot turret, Duke drive truck, Duke punch big alien in♥♥♥♥♥♥ Duke bungie jump off Hoover Dam, Duke do moar pew pew pew, Cycloid gets deaded. Duke (SPOILER) deaded by Nuke #Irony....... What the ♥♥♥♥....\nDuke Nukem Forever was a great concept back in the late 90s/early 2000s, sticking to the Duke 3D routes and keeping it as close to the original while adding new elements of gameplay into the mix that, by the trailers, seems to work out well for it. You got to keep all of your weapons, there was a health and armor system, levels weren't linear, and there was a ♥♥♥♥ING MOTORCYCLE!!! I don't mind a monster truck, but a motorcycle? That's the badass's main ride right there! You don't see a Hell's Angel member in a Honda Civic, just like Duke should be on a Harley rather than a truck. But anyway, Duke Nukem Forever 1998-2004 seemed to stick to it's original roots and not add all of that unneeded Halo garbage that it has now! The Duke Nukem Forever of 2011 was such a Halo and Call of Duty knock off, you could of slapped \"Call of Nukem: Halo Battlefield\" on there and the gameplay would still match the title! What the hell happened to Duke being able to carry 10+ weapons at a time and having to constantly save the game because you don't want to die and restart the episode, or how about how there was a health system?? Oh wait, don't let me forget to mention one of the worst parts of this game: Turret sections.\nIf there is a reviewer out there that hit the nail on the head, it was Angry Joe when he stated that \"The game had BEAUTIFUL turret sections... EXCEPT I CHECKED THE ♥♥♥♥ING BOX ART AND IT SAYS I'M SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING DUKE ♥♥♥♥ING NUKEM!!!\"\n-Duke Nukem Forever Review by Angry Joe.\nI couldn't have said it better myself, the game does NOT deserve to have turret sections, monster trucks, PLATFORMING, recharging health, 2-4 weapon limit, linear level design, bland outdated textures, buggy AI, and boring missions. I guess I could say that some of Duke's jokes made me chuckle a bit, but it seems like the game is trying to be more serious than funny...\n\"So, this is how the anticipation ends. First show of the long awaited comeback tour and the singer has hanged himself on the microphone chord, trying to sing anyway, forcing out a smile and choking out lyrics between grotesque spasms and you're wondering whether it's kinder to cut him down or swing on his legs to help him on his way.\"\n-DUKE NUKEM FOREVER: FOR REAL THIS TIME by Escapist\nI feel like the reviewers do a much better job at explaining this than I do, so you might as well check out Angry Joe's video and Escapist's video because they more accurately describe DNF.

But in some sections this trip down yesteryear way does wears thin.\nUltimately, if you ask me, DNF is a victim of circumstance. Not because it took thirteen years to come out, but because during that time the FPS genre had become standardized. Today a shooter isn't a shooter worth playing if it is without a robust multiplayer, a sense of realism, over the top melodrama, HATS, and if it isn't military shooter. Forget about it.

I am one of those longtime DN3D fans and i have to say, after playing through DNF the first time at launch and more recently a 2nd time, i still truly don't get all the hate for this game. IMO it's great fun, a fitting continuation of the franchise, and a decent return to gamedom for Duke.

This is not the game I expected, and didn't exactly want. I honestly wanted to like this game, but there's so many flaws that now I don't even recognize Duke.

Still a pale comparison to duke 3d's beign to have a whole epic armoury with you. The gunys aren't fun to use\nThe bosses can be killed by explosives ONLY.\nThe driving levels, omg the driving levels.\nThe vechiles control worse than a giant float of an strapped to a drump truck.\nThey emcompass a huge part of the game.  at least 50-60% of it.\nYou also have to collect gas cans 3-4 times during the monster truck level.\nAlso the being shrunk levels are also terribly done.\nThe humor is more or less he says something random rather than having a good text and you are expected to laugh. Also, sexual violation jokes. because why frag not make being a women sexually violated agiasnt her will into a joke.\nThe first time I played this game I quit right there during the \"you're ♥♥♥♥ed\" joke.\nIt wasn't funny and served to puncuate how this game should have stayed unreleased.\nSomeone at gearbox looked at that joke and said \"oh yeah, good to go, print that♥♥♥♥♥♥now\"\nSomeone at 2kgames game this a thumbs up to go a head as well.\nI get duke in duke 3d and manhatten project made  sexist jokes but never one the par of saying \"ha ha you got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.

Bulletstorm is more pretty and has more varied combat.  While Duke Nukem has more humor, platforming, and puzzles.  The single Player only took me about 7 hours on \"Come Get Some\"\nTo talk technical bad things - I didn't like only having 2 guns at a time and the inability to jump/climb onto objects.

All the people I know IRL who bash this game have played it on an outdated, low-perfoming console such as the xbox360 or PS3 (don't even think about correcting me: compared to a good PC, even the xboxONE and PS4 still suck immensely).\nIf you're still unsure, then wait until the game is on sale ($5 as of writing this review) or quit being a cheapskate and see what YOU think for yourself.

That is how long the world waited for a true sequel to Duke Nukem 3D. Stuck in the longest ever known development hell, switching engines multiple times, and winning a crapton of vaporware awards, Duke Nukem Forever seemed destined to never see the light of day. But see the light of day it did, thanks to the combined efforts of Triptych Games and Gearbox Software!\nTriptych Games was founded when 3DRealms closed it's doors back in 2009, and they worked out of their own homes for no pay to make DNF what it is today. Then in 2010, Gearbox Software bought the franchise, hired on Triptych, and helped them polish their work, resulting in the badass beast we know today.\nThe Duke Nukem series has always been known for it's balls-out irreverent sense of humor, and DNF continues that fine tradition of debauchery with gusto. The traditional Duke charm is firmly imbedded in the game's design, managing to give fans a good laugh along the way and in the process completely offending those who don't get Duke's particularly awesome brand of humor.\nThe gameplay is a melting pot of what's best about classic FPS games, and the best of their contemporary counterparts. Gone are random medkits and stimpacks, now we have a regenerating EGO bar that represents Duke's Dukeness. Let it drop to nothing, and he might not be able to shrug off that next bullet. Dive behind cover and rest a moment and you'll be back in action in quick order. Or you can take the manly route and use an execution move on an enemy, this instantly refills Duke's ego bar.\nThe signature interaction introduced by Duke Nukem 3D is back in force, with pool tables, pinball machines, weight benches, arcade games, air hockey, and more ready to entertain those who want to take a break from the carnage and just mess around.\nMost items give you a permanent EGO boost the first time you use them, to try and mess around with anything and everything. You can even recreate the infamous microwave scene from Maniac Mansion.\nDukes signature arsenal is back in former glory, and this is where the Xbox 360 version takes a bit of a sidestep from the PC counterpart, on PC they patched in the ability to carry four weapons at once, but on the console as of this writing you can still only carry two. Still, the game is amazingly balanced, with plenty of guns lying around to take your pick from. During boss fights you can usually find an ammo crate to keep the rockets flying, so don't be afraid to use your firepower.\nMultiplayer returns big time in DNF, with Dukematch, Team Dukematch, Capture the Babe (capture the flag, but easier on the eyes) and Hail to The King. A diverse array of maps are included, based on locations seen in the campaign. My personal favorite is Duke Burger, which sees the players shrink down to action-figure size, and let loose in the kitchen of the iconic fast-food joint. Earning EXP in multiplayer earns you new items to decorate your personal penthouse, and completing challenges gives you new shirts and hats to customize your Duke.\nDuke Nukem Forever may not be the greatest game of all time, but despite some long loading times on the Xbox 360 version it stands tall and proud in representation of the Duke franchise, and in my humble opinion it should be played by fans and newcomers to the series alike, as it finally brings closure to the most epically insane development saga in the history of gaming. Oh, and it kicks♥♥♥♥♥too!", "hours": 22.4, "username": "Nukkus", "products": 5093, "early_access": false},
