There are a couple of quite challenging one's but nothing that just a minute of logical thinking can't overcome.\nThe only part of the game that left me feeling a little disappointed was the story. It set's itself up really well and leave's question's waiting to be answered. The problem is, for most of the game you're involved in challenge's which have absolutely nothing to do with the story.\nThis in turn make's the story a rather routine quest to find someone and not much more.\nThis of course is only looking at the game as a stand alone experience. Syberia 2 and 3 will do so much more to expand on the story told here. It's only really something that will bother those not wanting to play the trilogy.\nI see people complaining that the game hasn't aged well. I really don't think it's that bad. I followed the small Windows 10 instructions within the Steam forums to get it working. After that, it only crashed once and I had no other real issues playing. The graphic's still do the job just fine.\nIf you're a point and click fan, go ahead a buy it.

Not so here - I did not finish even half of this title.\nTo be perfectly honest, I would rather give this game neutral feedback. I enjoy the artwork and movies - so much clockwork architecture and clever designs given life. What I experienced of the story is interesting, and has a level of realism to it other games in the genre lack. The phone calls especially add to this.\nUnfortunately the story is so slow and drawn out that, even though it is interesting stuff, it ends up just being a snooze-fest. Find an object to interact with or another zone to enter, click, wait. Rinse and repeat. All you end up doing is watch a pixellated person walking around all day, while you twiddle your thumbs waiting for Kate to finish your last instruction.\nThere's a reason why I say it's a staircase simulator. Most developers of this type of game would understand the need to put area divisions instead of things like stairs and ladders, which everyone knows are utterly boring and unnecessary. This game doesn't. Instead, all that boring stuff is included in the gameplay. Meaning there isn't any gameplay, just climbing. This is a pretty major let down, one that you can't ignore when deciding on whether to play or not.\nIt is good for one thing though - falling asleep at the keyboard. If you've never done that before and you're having trouble, just play this and you'll nod off without a hitch ;)\nThere are a lot of annoying things that artificially draw out the game and make it long-winded. Things like turning around to climb down stairs backwards, even though it looks fine to just climb down normally. The train driver automaton being a b*tch about paperwork and travel visas. Way, way, way too many pointless stairs that could have just been eliminated from the artwork in the first place to give the game better pacing.\nSo the game is both enjoyable and a snooze-fest. It can have great atmosphere, despite the slog, with great ambience in some areas, with things like birds and sounds helping to bring it to life, but this just wasn't enough for me. I'll just join Kate and go to sleep in the train.", "hours": 10.2, "username": "§єǫuєᴋʜaɴ ♃⚶", "products": 558, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

You'll visit 4 places, all different, but consistent in this strange time, that i find difficult to describe, there are some modern elements, some victorians, plus all the automaton deal.\nGameplay consists in the classic point and click, no surprises, you'll find puzzles, interactions and backtracking, sometimes insane backtracking, expecially if you start going back and forth to find random objects without knowing really what to do.\nThe story was really good, no spoilers, but you'll find yourself wanting and perfectly aligned with the main character's decision, if you enjoyed the game obviously. Also, you can find lots of background informations reading the documents you'll find around, sometimes required to progress.\nSo, yeah, play it, it won't be groundbreaking nowdays, but it's still an enjoyable story\nP.S. : Save often, sometimes there may be some graphical issues because of the compatibility, and one time i got stuck waiting for a call near the end of game, really not funny", "hours": 6.7, "compensation": "Product received for free", "username": "sparken11", "products": 457, "early_access": false},

But me, having played it for the story, I felt all the puzzles (with partly not entirely credible solutions,) all the tedious and time-consuming running back and forth to find stuff and apply it to other stuff in the right order (and even if you guess a solution you can't try it out before finding the right clue, or even when you fish the umpteenth blue salmon that you know the brown bear doesn't like, you can't just ditch it but have to run through several rooms to feed it to the bear just so your basket is empty to take new fish) and all those obstacles springing up from out of nowhere all the time distracting me from advancing the story.\nWith part 1 I checked a walkthrough occasionally. With part 2 I started real early, because not only does part 2 only show things you can interact with on mouse-over, but it also introduces panning screens. So you actually have to run to every corner of every screen to see if it starts panning and maybe reveals another exit. Or things that look like one big thing to interact with are sometimes multiple items and you end up clicking all over every interaction piece to make sure you don't miss anything. The last quarter of the game I basically finished with a walkthrough in front of me, because I was just fed up with all the distractions.\nIf you're looking for crazy puzzles and machines with lots of levers and buttons to be pressed in the right order, you'll be fine. If you enjoy such puzzles, you may even like the game, a lot, and get to appreciate the charming story that _is_ in there, somewhere. If you want the charming story and couldn't care less about all the complicated machines popping up in the most unlikely places, you may (like me) have difficulties.

It's about a American lawyer, Kate Walker, who is sent to France to complete the buyout of an automaton toy factory.  In the beginning, Kate's mindset is to get the heir of the toy factory to sign the contract and then fly back home immediately.  Seems like a easy task at first, but Kate soon finds out that the task is a lot more complicated than anticipated.  To find what she is looking for, she must travel across different locations.\nThe story starts off a bit slow, but things become more interesting the further you get into it. During her journey, you can sense that Kate's character evolves throughout.  The things that she was concerned about at the beginning of the journey become less important to her later on.  It is a journey not only about traveling to different locations, but also a journey about finding herself.  I was intrigued through most of it, and I thought the ending was very fitting!\nAnd yes, there are puzzles.  Some of the puzzles can be challenging, but I did not find any of them to be extremely difficult... Getting through the game without a walkthrough is feasible.  Soundtrack is very soothing, and the scenery is gorgeous.  For being a 2002 game, the graphics are really top-notch!  The game can also be funny at times!\nI went through this game for the first time just recently (and I never played any other games developed by Microids), so I'm not speaking out of nostalgia.

There's times where I miss how hard games can get, with the pass of times the difficulty of most of the games seems become easier. Syberia turned out to be very satisfying, those puzzles without clues leave you just with your ingenuity, luck and patience and I greatly enjoy that. The feeling of accomplishment was what I loved the most if I am sincere, getting to see every place, to see Kate Walker interact with the whole new world she has gotten herself into and how she starts knowing parts of her soul she didn't know before. I loved her, it was such an interesting main character. I'm very excited to see her in Syberia II.\nAt last, but not least important, I shall mention the music and the art, the videos! I found myself waiting excited for the next video. On other hand, their illustrations, maps, cities, towns, characters, everything of it was just delightful.\nI recommend this game, if you enjoy good pieces of art, good character development and interactions, good music and adventure.

The presentation is a little creaky after 16 years, but this is a game that should be played by anyone who appreciates a good story.\nMost impressive is the sense of immersion in intricate environments stretching from the French Alps, across Eastern Europe and the former USSR, to the shores of the erstwhile Aral Sea. While the character models render at native resolution, the pre-rendered background appear grainy and pixelated at contemporary monitor resolutions. Fortunately, the production design is uniformly excellent and each location feels like a real, lived-in place.\nMany adventure games of the 1990s relied upon arcane puzzles and tedious pixel hunts to pad out their length. Syberia forgoes any of this nonsense and displays icons over every piece of environment that is interactive. While this breaks the immersion somewhat, it also streamlines the gameplay. Puzzles are logically presented and won't have players running for a walkthrough.\nThe game ends somewhat abruptly and essentially requires purchase of the sequel to continue the story.

The story is both intriguing and compelling, the graphics still look great and hold their details, and the characters are awesome, interesting, funny, and tragic.\nThis game shows off the artistic talent and genius of Benoit Sokal, a Beligian comic artist and the game developer for Syberia I and II. After my last time playing it, I began to realize the small details that make a game's story great and its characters equally so. Our main protagonist, named Kate Walker, is an international lawyer from a law firm in New York...and her life there is less than satisfactory. Granted, these details are revealed through short phone calls with her doting, somewhat air-headed mother, her so-called \"best friend\" Olivia, her impatient, jaded boss, and her fiance, whom Kate discovers over the period of the game she is not compatible with. Good thing too, because her fiance is a total ***hole.\nThe stark contrast between her life in New York City as a lawyer (which, like I said, is only revealed through a series of phone calls over a period of the gameplay) and her travels throughout Europe looking for an old man with a fierce imagination and an obvious genius as she visits the *often* sad, small towns with their eccentric residents show us that our main protagonist is evolving a newer, more enlightened perspective. She starts out cynical and jaded, yet as she continues on her journey to search for Hans Voralberg, a brilliant inventor with a child-like mind and personae, she becomes more aware or her surroundings and the people she encounters, and begins to realize that there is more to life than crony, greedy bosses andcheating partners. She found a whole new world of wanderlust and the mechanical dreams of a brilliant progeny, and you bet she's going pursue it. Syberia absolutely shows our heroine evolving as the train she's boarded on plunges deeper into the arctic tundras of freezing, desolate Russia.\nThis game has a steampunk aesthetic, and has an acute sense of small, mechanical detail. Of course, this is one of the highlight;s of Syberia. Steampunk is a very difficult genre to work with, as it relies on both fantastical yet realistic, mechanical elements. Of course, Benoit Sokal knew what he was doing and not only used steampunk in an aesthetic sense, but manager to interweave its elements to♥♥♥♥♥highlights to the importance of the story.\nSyberia is a brilliant, beautiful, imaginitive game. This game had a lot of love, effort, and creativity poured into it. This is a game where once you start, you don't stop until you realized you've been playing for 4 hours straight. This game isn't that long nor is it difficult...it's just right.

Why did it lack it? There's a bunch of reasons. The soundtrack isn't as catching, imagery isn't as distinctive (due to all the snow), seemingly more stilted dialogue/VA, and etc. The game also includes a subplot which, frankly, is more distracting than complimenting.\nAnother big reason is that there aren't as many locations. The original Syberia has four distinct locations -- Syberia 2 has two. Both games have areas 'in-between', but, even then, the 'in-between' areas of the original carried a far stronger impression because there is more unique imagery. The 'in-between' areas of Syberia 2 is mostly bland snow.\nSo all of the above combined to dramatically decreased the atmosphere of Syberia 2 to its detriment. However, I still recommend it for fans of the original because the game is a major plot continuation of the story from the first game. I suppose if you don't care for the original's story, that won't matter, but I grew to love Kate/Oscar/Hans so I really wanted to know what happens next.\nOn its own, I honestly wouldn't recommend it, but if you love the original and/or, like me, preparing for the upcoming release of Syberia 3, this game would be a worthy purchase.", "hours": 11.1, "username": "MarioTGreat", "products": 164, "early_access": false},

I particularly enjoyed the theme in the communist factory.\nThe story. As I said, this isn’t so much a game as a guided experience. Syberia has been described as “a journey through the failed utopias of the 20th century” which is a wonderful explanation. I would add that it is an exploration of the topics of obsession, disappointment, age, and lost potential. A deeply melancholic and thoughtful experience with a well written story and characters.\nCons:\nThe puzzles weren’t particularly challenging. Some had a bit of a forced logic to solve them or went a bit against intuition, which can be frustrating. However, the game doesn’t resort to the too common “push the boxes” or “arrange the pipes/wires/yarn” kind of puzzles so at least every problem is an original one.\nOn occasion I felt that the pace was a bit slow and that I had to do a lot of reading. However, take this with a grain of salt. Since the steam version comes with six languages I used the game to improve my French (very good voice work, by the way) so I may not be totally fair here.

{"product_id": "46510", "page": 11, "page_order": 8, "recommended": false, "date": "2017-02-17", "text": "I am a total sucker for adventure games. My love affair with them started way back with Colassal cave, Scott Adams Adventures, and the famous Infocom games. Back then things were text based. Wishbringer, Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy, Enchanter, Suspended, Planetfall, Bureaucracy, The Lurking HOrror, and the everpopular ZORK were among my favorites. Adventure games have one game play premise. The Barter System (and right now the This for That Schoolhouse Rock song is playing in my head).  But that is the essence of the system. I have this, I give this person THAT and get another thing in return or they do something for me. Thus I progress in the story.\nNow the purpose really is to tell a fun and interesting story while loading up with these puzzle exchanges. Graphics adventures of the sort were inevitable. THe best known were the Sierra company's titles like the King's QUest series, thus the POINT AND CLICK adventure was born. Thus a problem. Instead of getting a description of a room and things you can pick up, you are given a picture and have to see that these blocky pictures are actually objects as well as that there are exits...and sometimes not. Sure you can hover over an area to see if you can interact, but therein lies the problem. You HAVE to make things logical enough so that people will not only be able to tell where to go and that there might be something you can pick up.\nSyberia 2 suffers bigtime from both obstacles. It is a sequel to a previous Syberia game, but that doesn't really matter. YOu can pick up easily that the lead character Kate has been away from work for awhile...and never wants to return. She instead sets off on another journey with an elderly friend to find Syberia, a place of myth and legend. It's an intriguing beginning that basically leads nowhere fast. Like King's Quest V, it suffers from lots of illogic in tasks you must do. Give a alligator to this character to get a key? No that's an exaggeration but there are some of the puzzles like that. THere is a lot of bait and switch in it. Oh I need a small key to get through this door. Rats. It doesn't work I think. Am I doing this right? I need a coin for this contraption. I have many coins. They don't seem to work. I have no idea what to do now.\nThis uncertainty is there because of the gameplay engine. When you hover it is a bit ambivvalent in what's happening. It uses a weird symbol to indicate that you CAN'T do something that is small and unclear and most importantly unlabeled and uninstructed. There is NO instruction whatsoever in fact. So you will waste a lot of time, say....trying a key in a door and wondering what you are doing wrong, not totally realizing that....it's just the wrong key....go find another one. It doesn't tell you it is wrong in ways that are obvious. Other games have big eyeball icons for looking, speech ballon for talking, hand for grabbing. Can't really say I can identify what the cursor is doing at any particular time except that it changes. Another gameplay issue is objects. You can use objects in your inventory to interact with objects in a given location. That isn't really obvious either. Mixed with the obtuse icons and cursors it takes a bit to figure it out when a simple 1 minute training area would have taken care of this.\nIt also definitely lacks logic in that it won't let you say and do things that seem obvious. Example. You talk to someone. They have a broken thing. You have a long conversation about your goal, your traveling companion, his ability to invent and fix things and that the two character even KNOW each other. THen in the end nothing becomes of it. It is obvious that you should go back to your friend and talk to him to tell him to go fix the thing right? But when you do it doesn't give you that option. Why not? I think the characters stand around asking themselves that.\nThe characters are indeed very good characters, some a bit natural, some cartoony. The lead character especially is appealing. However most of the characters don't want to help you with anything. Then out of nowhere they do. Then instead of actually saying logical things that flow, they clam up simply waiting around...bored in their existance. They almost look like they are frustrated about having nothing interesting to say. Talking with someone is easy. Just click on them and it gives you a series of topics to discuss. But that soon becomes a complete grind. They recycle information SO MUCH within each topic. Nothing goes in sequential order. You can get 5 layers deep in ONE topic conversation only to be told the exact same thing 2 layers down in another. And those conversations seem to go on forever without really getting to the point.\nI do like the characters in general. The stories of each person are fine and make you want to know them more. The lead character is appealing enough to easily get most people on her side. But....this game and story is a bit of a depressing downer right from the getgo. I love the beginning of how her bosses are worried about her and that she hasn't come back to the office. \"She's gone.\" says one. Meaning...wanderlust has totally consumed her. She's a different person now and will never return. Kate does indeed to be fulfilling that role...trying to help her dying old inventor friend find the mythical Syberia. So good strong beginning instantly sent on a downward depressing spiral dealing with an elderly friend whose mind is not all there and whose health slowly\nfact there are a series of interactions and puzzles dealing specifically with that. I don't want to watch a man dying and have to go through a lot of things just to get him treated just to be told he's going to die. On the upside this is a world like MYST, like Likehouse. Full of robots and contrption. Granted it has this supercharged locatamotive run by a robot and still has to use coal. What's with that? It then goes through a town whose economy is nonexistent because it has no travelers or money coming in on the last stop to nowhere. No wonder all the characters just stand around fidgety waiting for something to happen (which never does)\nOverall there is no brightness at all to this game. Not in puzzles, not in interaction, not in story, not in logic. THere are some things that you just happen upon and they work. THere are others you didn't even realize and never would have guessed. THen there is the problem of having to constantly go from one of a towen to the other to your train back again, etc. It's a grind. Not fun at all. Especially when location logic too seems to suffer. LEt's see if I go under the train track I should be here then back this way I'm at the stairs. No wait I'm now at an engine. BUt that should be over by the house. Location placement is a bit off and not logical either making that running grind worse. Putting things as far apart as possible just to lengthen gameplay and then confuse you in how to get there....is a very very bad idea.\nAt end, the only great thing to say about this is that the characters are well formed, the scenerey gorgeous, the voice acting is great, especially Kate and the pearshaped Russian guy that sounds like Boris Badenov from Bullwinkle.", "hours": 5.4, "user_id": "76561198004585919", "username": "sircrimsonfox", "products": 401, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

But which part outweighs which is the real question. Well, let's break it down.\nYou play as an American lawyer Kate Walker who's on a trip to a fictional village in France to sign a contract for a toy factory takeover. Unfortunately, its current owner passes away and there's only one person left in the family to give her the signature. However, their whereabouts are unknown and so Kate's journey across Central and Easter Europe starts.\nGoing further into the plot would reveal major spoilers so I'll leave it at that. The locations in the game are built around the steampunk aesthetic and come with a huge attention to detail. Highly immersive ambience and a beautiful soundtrack. As you traverse the areas, you stumble upon several characters, documents and of course occasional puzzles that progress the story. Nothing groundbreaking about the dialogue and not only do you have to read A LOT, you also have to memorize certain bits as they hold clues to some of the puzzles. For someone who loves to read, this isn't a minus but it does extend the playtime artificially. The game ends abruptly with a cliffhanger and leaves just enough room for a sequel.\nNow, since this is an interactive adventure and not just a movie, I have to address it's problems in that department. First of all, the pacing. It really puts your patience to the test, running between interest points takes forever...and you will hate the stairs here. Absolutely everything takes too long to execute. There is another game made by the same developer, Still Life, which shares some similarities with Syberia, except that it never felt like a drag. This is a huge deal and I don't need to explain how awful it becomes when you get lost or just can't find the next clue. Speaking of, the puzzles range from simplistic \"use the items you found along your path\" to frustrating \"how in hell would you figure that out\". As stated earlier, the solution is sometimes to be attained from the found documents, but you never really know when you make use of it. Which again leads to thinking whether you could have missed something when in fact it's right there in your inventory. Another issue I didn't have to deal with in Still Life.\nAll things considered, if you are up to experience a memorable narrative taking its painfully dull and slow progress into account, this might be a good pick for you.", "hours": 12.1, "username": "Яedly Яed.暗赤色@Tsundere-Tiddy", "products": 518, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Hear me out, here.\nNot too long ago they had the \"Syberia Bundle\" on sale, so I thought I'd buy it with nothing to lose. It couldn't be that bad, if there's another sequel on the way, right?\nAgain, as an adventure game, it's not bad. In fact, I think it did pretty good at setting up some challenging puzzles. But it's also nothing special. In a game like this, solving a puzzle is supposed to mean advancing the plot, but this game has barely enough plot to write a single novella, even if you use 100% of content from both Syberia games.\nHere's a quick TL;DR:\n1) The plot is weak and nonsensical.\n2) World building and character development were thrown out the window altogether. You just have to take everyone's word for it that \"Kate's Changed,\" because I can't tell a difference.\n3) The game features some glaring samples of bad level design, forcing the player to deal with issues that game devs had known were bad ideas for at least a decade before.\n((((SPOILER))))\nPlot of the first game can be summed up as \"Young Lawyer Kate Walker goes to France to finalize paperwork on an automaton factory's takeover after the owner dies. However, the owner reveals in her will that her brother was still alive, and therefore she wants all her assets sent to him. All things considered, this should have still been the end of Kate's job, but her boss tells her not to come home until she gets that paperwork signed, so she travels to Russia hoping that just sort of maybe this brother will be there. On her way, we learn that her boss is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that her boyfriend is cheating on her with her best friend. All things considered, it's somewhat understandable that she chooses to run away with this brother, Hans, once she finally meets him.\" Sure, there's a train whose engineer is a robot who is your companion, but he refuses to lift a finger to assist in any way beyond \"drive the train.\"\nSecond game, Kate's traveling with Oscar the robot train driver and Hans the mammoth-obsessed idiot whose only redeeming feature is his ability to make Automatons. Hans gets sick and nearly dies, but he gets better after killing Oscar and turning his body into a brace. In the end, you make it to the magical island of Syberia, where wooly mammoths are still alive. ((((END SPOILER))))\nConsidering what I know about the story so far, Syberia III is most likely going to just be \"Kate goes back to civilization after completing her journey\" and that's all we're going to get. And the worst part is, Kate's motivation is never clear. If these games made anything clear about her, it's that she isn't an idiot by any stretch of the imagination. Plus she was a lawyer. She knew her rights. She knew that her boss couldn't exactly fire her just because he didn't know all the facts before sending her into the field and it turns out the situation was more complicated than they expected. If she loved her job so much that she was willing to travel from France to Russia just to get one document signed, she would have known that travelling from France to Russia alone with no help was beyond her job description. Why the hell did she decide to throw away her relationships just to make her ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss happy?\nMy other major complaint about the game is that there is next to no world building or character development, although I guess I already talked about poor character development. One of the main staples of point and click adventure games is that you can click on things to learn about them, or at least what the character knows about it. This helps you understand your environment and your character, but it's something that was sorely lacking from this game. Even some of those stupid Putt Putt and Freddie Fish games from the late 90's/early 2000's for kids 6 and under (which I played when I was 6 and under) did a better job of this, and they did it for an audience with a much shorter attention span. This game was for the 16-20 audience, and failed to deliver on one of the simplest questions anyone could ask of a story: \"Why should I care?\" Due to the fact you're surrounded by  strange devices, the sci-fi loving part of me cared from the first cutscene, but I could never rationalize caring beyond that.\nLastly, although I've said many times that the game aspect was good, this game is the poster child for bad level design. In Syberia I, you are forced to run from one area to another multiple times, and half the areas in between bear no relevance to solving any puzzles or continuing the story. In Syberia II, they don't fix it. In fact, the only thing that got an update as far as I could tell was the layout of the train interior. That made no sense to update, though, since there would have been no time or reason for our characters to renovate it. I mean, Syberia II picks up one stop after Syberia I as far as I can tell. But that's the biggest gripe I think you can throw at any game series: This was a problem in the first game. You didn't fix it.\nLast thing. You know how the bullet points here on Steam say that the game has \"Rich and intriguing new characters with new, realistically detailed 3D environments?\" ignoring the game's age, I can't tell a difference between the graphics from the first game and the  second game. Also, the new characters? One's a dog, the other's a thief who follows you. I will say, though, that the dog is a good boy.\nI regret to say that once Syberia III costs 12.99 or less, I'll probably cave and buy it as well, but I can't see it being anything other than a quick cash grab.", "hours": 13.1, "username": "Urcofox", "products": 293, "early_access": false},

Kate Walker has abandoned her life in New York, and instead continued her journey with Hans Voralberg on the special clockwork train that is on the rails that leads to the departing location to the ever mysterious island of Syberia. An island that is said to inhabit the last surviving mammoths on Earth. Despite the fact that the island may be a myth and that no human being has seen a living mammoth for the past 10,000 years. Hans is determined to go to the island and witness the site of the mammoths that he'd dreamed of since childhood. Kate, who previously spent a lot of time hunting down and learning more about Hans, is also determined to help the kind elderly automaton builder fullfill his dream. During their travels, they encounter both kind folk and intimedating foes, as well as dangers of the wilderness that effects the journey in some ways. Meanwhile Kate's law firm had previously sent out a private eye to hunt her down because of A. She has the paper work for the merger of the automaton factory and toy company and B. Kate's family is worried sick and are demanding for her safe return. Despite all of the odds, Kate will go out and beyond to help Hans get to Syberia at all costs. This sequel is just as great as the first game, while the majority of the game is set in the wilderness, you do get to see a good number of automaton technology like in the first game. The graphics are slightly improved and the locations are just as beautiful as the first game. Originally this plot was going to be part of the first game, but it was decided that it should split into two games instead. Which was a wise choice as it would of been a really long game if it did.

Their heyday was primarily in the late 80s and mid-90s. But in those times the interfaces were clunkier and the games themselves were often 2D or some hybrid of FMV and pseudo-3D. Along comes Syberia in 2002 to deliver us an adventure realized in fully 3D character models, attractive pre rendered backgrounds, and an intriguing premise. It's well appreciated.\nSyberia follows Kate Walker, a New York lawyer sent into the French Alps to settle the acquisition of a clockwork toy factory by a massive American corporation. As expected, such routine matters do not go as expected and Kate learns that the owner of the factory has passed away and left information about a long-lost brother who is now heir to the factory. Kate leaves on a journey that takes her across western and eastern Europe, retracing the heir's steps, hounded by phone calls from her increasingly livid boss and faithless fiance.\nThe interface for Syberia is quite clean. Inventory, notes, and clues are gathered into a single menu that unfolds into a second section depending on what you want to use or examine. I never got lost searching for information or items. Likewise, the conversation system is also simple and easy to manage. Kate has access to a limited number of topics (she can learn more) that can be used on most NPCs. As opposed to some of the adventure games of yesteryear that allowed the player to type in potential keywords and/or questions during conversations, Syberia keeps things mostly linear and self-contained.\nThe atmosphere of Syberia reminds me of a Victorian era novel. The artwork is often ornate and based in art nouveau with its love for arcs and curves. The clockwork toy factory and its automaton creations evoke steampunk imagery that blends the setting between the real and surreal. Lighting and weather effects deliver a sense that Kate is drifting further and further into an unknown frontier. Civilization grows more sparse and eccentric as she journeys, but not at the cost of tone. Syberia is occasionally satirical and tongue-in-cheek with its dialogue, but rarely becomes so silly that the overall mystery and emerging wonder of the world is lost.\nAt its heart,  Syberia is a story about self-discovery as much as answering the mystery of the lost heir. Kate's interactions with other characters evolve subtly. Much like her boss and fiance, Kate begins her story focused on business and the superficiality of modern American life. As she delves deeper into the story of the clockwork factory, its late owner, and missing heir, she awakens to feelings and ideas she never expected. Her mission is soon driven as much by curiosity and fascination as obligation to her work. Phone calls with friends, family, and work grow less familiar as Kate's emotional and psychological distance from them gradually matches her geographical distance.\nThe puzzles are pretty simple and most can be solved with items and clues found nearby. I did have some issues with the conversation system that wasted time, though. Sometimes in the process of solving a puzzle, you must return to an NPC you already spoke to and try exhausting the dialogue options with them again because they have something new to say or give you. The linearity of some solutions harms the game occasionally. I would go through dialogue topics out of order from what the developers seemed to expect more often than not, receiving information and puzzle prompts that weren't properly solvable yet. I would run around confused for several minutes before finally returning and discover that I had to ask about something else that would cause the NPC to give me the item I needed to solve the puzzle they already sent me after. Fortunately, this only happened a few times.\nThe pacing of the story becomes a bit rushed during its third act. There's a villain character who I would've enjoyed learning more about, but the developers were content to keep their villain mostly one-dimensional. The conflict the villain introduces builds up, climaxes, and then gets resolved so quickly that I wonder now if there had been a longer story arc for this encounter that was abandoned during development. However, the overall narrative of Syberia remains intact and only becomes more interesting, hiccups aside. It whacks you with a big cliffhanger, but I was enthusiastic about it, not annoyed. I'm of the mind that if a game ends leaving you genuinely interested in playing its sequel or even just playing the game again, it's automatically a recommendation.", "hours": 12.7, "username": "ExissM", "products": 397, "early_access": false},

But, oh man, does this game have atmosphere.\nPlaying Syberia is a little bit like reading a book from the 1800s. Slow-paced, a little dated, and a little cliche. But if you, like me, enjoy quieting your mind a little to take in all the beauty of something like that, you're going to find a gem.\nThe puzzles may be easy, but that isn't for lack of respect for the player. In fact, if you don't pay attention and take notes during conversations with NPCs, you're going to find yourself lost. The game points you in the right direction, but it does so while relying solely on logic. Nothing gimmicky or contrived here.\nThe mechanics are solid and well designed--nearly every time I ran into a wall with a puzzle, I was soon able to see that I only had myself to blame for not exploring enough or not paying enough attention during conversations. There was one puzzle that used a long-forgotten phone call as a hint that I never would have been able to solve without help, but that's the only frustration I can think of, and it was a minor one.\nUnlike many adventure games, Syberia has a more realistic tone. You aren't going to find \"punny\" puzzles or witty flavortext. It's a calm, grounded little game with some stunning art design and sympathetic characters.

Some pros and cons:\nPros:\nFor a game with 2002 graphics, the art and scenery is lovely! Also, the variety and size of locations is very pleasing, so you're not just stuck in one world that gets repetitive.\nThe \"puzzles\" are not complicated at all (this could be considered a pro if you are looking for a game that is more for passing the time and relaxation than perplexing your brain). The \"puzzle\" part of the game is more about finding missing objects and putting them where they go, or figuring out who you need to talk to in order to get where you want to go.\nI absolutely LOVE the storyline and steampunk theme! It adds depth and creativity to the game. It is very detailed in my opinion, especially when it came to areas that acted as more of a \"buffer zone\" between locations of importance-- they were definitely not skipped on.\nThe main character is very sassy, which made me laugh a lot when she interacts with characters who are... unique.\nCons:\nFirst thing that started bugging me was how she walks reeeeaallyy sloo\nand sometimes the area you are in is on the larger side, so you can take like three sips of coffee before she even reaches the other side (I counted lol). However, overtime, I did get used to it, and eventually figured out that double clicking makes her run, which speeds up the process a bit.\nCharacter interaction was very entertaing at times (especially when it came to Oscar), but other times I feel like certain words got a tad too repetitive within conversation, and wayy too lonngg at times.\nMost of the puzzles weren't really... puzzles. Personally, they weren't hard enough for me/aren't the ones that I consider puzzles. Again, it's mostly finding things and putting stuff back together again.\nCrashes. THis is a pretty old game, so it was prone to a lot of crashes if you 1) left it on too long (like for hours long btw 2) if you switch to and from different windows on your computer.

With much improved graphics (that still holds up pretty well even today) and a musical score to match, this game has excellent story telling and solid puzzles to keep you interested throughout.\nThey upgraded the conversation tree, so when you are interacting with other characters in the game, the conversation dissappears from your choices you can be made, that way you aren't asking the same thing over and over. Helps keep the game moving. There are more puzzles that offer more of a challenge and more characters to interact with along with better laid out places to visit. the cutscenes are even better and more frequent thoughout the game as well.  An overall excellent game with an excellent ending.\nThey said this would be the last Kate Walker adventure for her, but coming next year(2017) is Syberia 3, so I am very much ready to see what is next.

I'm not saying this game wasn't good, but I feel Kate's arc really developed and ultimately crescendos in the final scene of the first game and maybe that storyline was more important than the journey. She doesn't really need this game because her story was, in essence, over. The story felt less important to me because instead of acting on your main character's motivations you are doing this for Hans, who is a one dimensional character, thus making the games progression very predictable and it doesn't feel as much like an adventure as just wrapping up the subplot in the first game.\nBut this game was made and of course I played it, needing to know what happened next. I recommend it to fans of the first game because it adds a satisfying closure to the tales of Hans, Oscar, and the Youkol people. The cast of new character introduced in this game were not as memorable as the first, except for Youki. The 'bad guys' seemed to be shoehorned in just to get the train to stop at a couple extra location and I felt they ultimately detract from the story.\nThe game continues directly after the first, also featuring identical gameplay. You will read journals that outline the history of locations and using these to clue into the answer to the puzzles and slowly jog between screen after screen just to find out you need to backtrack. The backdrops were not quite as good but there are still some interesting areas.", "hours": 11.8, "user_id": "76561198006003555", "username": "Грустная Сука", "products": 817, "early_access": false},

Syberia II is for fans that weren't frustrated with Kate's decision in the end of the first game. But I guess there would be no sequel if that decision wasn't made.  The gameplay is worse than the first game. They have removed the icons for clickable items on the screen  and now you must follow if Kate is glaring at a particular direction in the world to see if you can interact with an object. Or just pixel hunt. This is frustrating because if you miss an item then you have to go back and look for it without being able to fast forward to that place.  Most of the puzzles are trial and error apart from the penultimate.\nSo in conclusion, way more casual than the first one, better cutscenes, beautiful artwork, frustrating gameplay. Story doesn't add anything new apart from introducing more eerie moments. It is an enjoyable journey for the fans overall. Non-Syberia fans should skip this.\nPS.

When I learned that Syberia 3 was in the works, a fire got lit underneath me and I finally played and finished Syberia 2 in preparation. I am so glad that I didn't play Syberia 2 until 3 was announced because I think I would have some seriously unanswered questions, but lets start from the beginning.\nSyberia II starts immediately after Syberia ends, so it is not so much a sequel as it is a continuation of the story. Now if you think that a game that has the story of a New York lawyer named Kate Walker going to Eastern Europe to wrap up a business deal and ends up instead helping an old man who is a genius with building automatons (NOT robots) go to the supposedly fictional island of Syberia where mammoths still live is boring, then move along. If however you think that that plot has possiblities you have to play it. I dare say it will be unlike any game you play. I know it stands out for me.\nWhere to even begin? I love the world that Benoit Sokal has created. Even though it is mostly snow, and blizzards and vey remote locations on the fringe of civilization, it is gorgeous. The cut scenes are exciting, beautiful, and add to the overall mystic feel of the game. The soundtrack is a wonderful blend of regular orchestral music or a tribal feel, depending on where you are in the game.\nI love the characters. Seriously, if I were to pick a favorite heroine, it would be a tie between Commander Shephard and Kate Walker. I think Kate is that amazing. She doesn't save the world, but she questions the importance of having the ideal job in an ideal place. In her case it's a promising career in New York City. She learns how important it is to follow your dreams, and help others realize theirs, despite how crazy or off the beaten path they are. It's a real life lesson, and I think that is what makes her so special. The cast of characters that surround her are also memorable. I love Oscar. He may come off as annoying to some but personally I would love to go on a train adventure with him. The story really focuses on Hans, whom Kate is helping reach Syberia. It is his dream that is the focus and what drives Kate. The dynamic between these three makes this game special, and at times heartbreaking.\nOf course, you can't have an adventure game without the puzzles. The key is to talk to everyone about everything you can. This will give you clues about where to go. Each area feels like a kind of level, so there are only so much backtracking. The puzzles are everywhere from pretty easy, to definitely having to think. It will just depend of your experience with adventure games.\nNow I must address one thing - the ending. They got it right, mostly. Once the journey is over, there is definitely a loose string - Well, what now Kate Walker? Luckily, we will be getting the answer in Syberia 3, and I can't wait to see what new adventure she finds herself in.", "hours": 14.0, "username": "Pointnclickster", "products": 442, "early_access": false},

{"product_id": "46500", "page": 19, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-05-03", "text": "  Syberia is one of the most emotional games I've ever played, which is quite a feat considering there aren't that many principal characters and many of them are emotionless robots. There are deeply cutting, overarching themes running through the experience that are timeless: destroyed beauty, flawed ideologies, infidelity, Peter Pan Syndrome, the inevitable march forward of technological progress and the loss of humanity. How Syberia manages to tackle such dark and depressing issues yet remain whimsical and keep you full of wonder is the mark of truly masterful writing and game design.\n \n  In a modern context, a video game about economic progress and relationship troubles should rightly illicit some skepticism and groans, as “mature games” have devolved into a sort of subgenre that usually treats it's audience like complete ♥♥♥♥ing morons with no ability to parse subtext and nuance. You could go down a checklist of cliches that would (and should) instantly turn you off: “the environment is a character”, “the protagonist really grows on her journey”, etc. Here they don't feel like buzzwords, however. Syberia is art and storytelling, minus the pretension and virtue signaling.\n \n  You play the game as Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York on a seemingly simple mission to get a signature from the last living heir to an obsolete toy factory. Arriving in what initially looks like a quaint European town, things quickly get very strange and her job gets exponentially more complicated. Not only has the heir died, but in her will she confesses that her brother is still alive, her family had faked his death, and his whereabouts are unknown. Kate goes above and beyond the call of duty, launching a one-woman investigation to find the mysterious genius/retard Karl Vorslberg. It's not a simple task, as Karl spent nearly his entire life designing intricate clockwork trinkets and automatons, up to and including a train to take himself to the fabled land of Syberia to look for the last living mammoths.\n \n  Kate boards the train, following the clues she's found and traveling from station to station, each stop more surreal and absurd than the next. All of the locations are past their prime, crumbling monuments ravaged by time and forgotten by modern society. The inhabitants she encounters haven't fared much better; lost souls either reveling in their past glory, going through the motions like automatons themselves, or driven mad from isolation and false promises. Kate interviews them, hoping to uncover more information about Karl and the impact he had on each locale. She also grows increasingly distant from the “real” world the further down the track she goes. Faced with majestic sights, essentially becoming the biographer of a genius who would not and could not let go of childlike wonder, her mundane, adult life fades into the background. Incoming calls from her friends, family, lover, and work become either uninteresting or tools to help her on her mission of discovery.\n \n  Gameplay consists of fairly standard adventure game interactions; you use the cursor to control Kate's movements, pointing and clicking to guide her. The circular reticle will light up when it's possible to move to another pre-rendered scene, or change icons if other actions are available. Talking to NPCs brings up a dialogue notebook with discussion choices, which will fill out as you obtain more information. All the voice acting is top notch, with a wide variety of accents and personality types. Kate especially is wonderful. You'll pick up items, add them to your inventory, and use them on objects... as is expected from the genre. This really is the sweet spot for adventure games as far as I'm concerned: there is some pixel hunting, but the fidelity is high enough that it's not in the literal sense. Solutions to puzzles are usually common sense, or the game actually wants you to tinker around with complex-looking machinery as part of the experience. There's nothing here that should stump you for days or have you running for a walkthrough; thorough exploration and observation is key, and it's still satisfying to solve the mechanical trials.\n \n  While graphically Syberia is starting to show it's age, the sense of awe and beauty still shines through in most cases. The 3-D character models look a little rough, but thankfully the point-and-click navigation saves us from having to deal with godawful tank controls of the era. The 2-D backgrounds are pixelated but gorgeous. Oftentimes you may wonder why certain screens exist, since there are no real gameplay reason for them to be there; just “empty space”. They're there because they're pretty.\n \n  Syberia is one of those games that's not technically “perfect”; you could nitpick some pacing problems or a puzzle or two that doesn't pay off, or some dialogue that's awkward or a bit too on the nose, but as a package it's absolutely fantastic. The unique, heartfelt story is something everyone should experience, and it's an adventure game you should play even if you generally don't care for adventure games. It welled me up with emotions, and I'm usually an old, crusty automaton.", "hours": 14.0, "user_id": "76561198004811351", "username": "AbsoluteDeicide", "products": 684, "early_access": false},

You play as Miss Kate Walker, NY lawyer extraordinaire and slightly prissy investigator compelled to adventure across Europe and the Urals in search of the elusive heir to the Voralberg manufacturing plant. Initially, Kate's interest is as shallow as the sales contract she's been hired to conclude, but your adventure doesn't let that state of affairs last. In a series of beautifully imagined cities, the mystery of the Voralberg automatons, the shadowy Siberian Youkol tribe, mammoths, cold war engineering, and personal drama unfolds in puzzle after puzzle. Each challenge is integral to the world and the story, transforming Kate's character and making it difficult to tear yourself away.\nIn terms of gameplay, this is classic point and click from the early aughts, and is a fairly clean and easily navigable interface, though it takes a moment to get used to the dialogue setup, which is listed by general topic rather than your opening line. The graphics are great for the time and more than sufficient to show both the details of the puzzles and the creators' love for the environments. The puzzles themselves are straightforward, but may require a little creativity; several objects and areas are only accessible once Kate has spoken with another character to acquire a motive or a key.  The soundtrack is excellent and the English dub voice actors are quite good, so it remains enjoyable throughout and has good replay value.

{"product_id": "46500", "page": 20, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-04-24", "text": "Well. After having this in my library for something like 4 years, I FINALLY played it through. I started last fall, then took a hiatus in Jan., then finished it up over the last week. I had bought it as part of the Meridian pack, and there are STILL a lot in there I've never touched--yet. Anyway. I understand this game is somewhat controversial in the favorability department. I hand it a thumbs up, albeit a less than enthusiastic thumb.\nFirst, I found the artwork and character design very good, if not actually outstanding. The steampunk vibe is excellent, and reminds me of Sierra's old masterpiece \"Lighthouse: The Dark Being\", considered by many to be the most insanely difficult adventure game ever made, and certainly among the best. In fact, at one point, my wife, who doesn't even play this type of game, looked over my shoulder and asked if that's what it was! Said it sounded a lot like it. Another aspect I found pleasing and familiar is that heroine Kate Walker bears a resemblance to Alex Vance, heroine of Half Life 2 and its sequels, probably my favorite game series of all time. And while this is a very different style of game, Kate also has that same tough-as-nails determination and willingness to get her hands dirty. In one sequence, she escapes a ruined underground complex through a ventilation duct -- shades of Dr Freeman himself! In fairness to Microids, let it be noted that Syberia was released more than 2 years BEFORE Alyx was helping Freeman shoot zombies.\nI found most of the puzzles to be of satisfying difficulty, right in the Goldilocks zone, not too hard, not too easy, but just right. I believe I only had to go the hints (UHS reader, a valuable classic!) twice, and BOTH involved using the telephone -- I don't think it's a spoiler to say that at least twice you must make phone calls to get necessary clues -- and the first time (if I recall correctly) invokes an absolutely ABSURD coincidence! The other game it reminded me of irresistably was Douglas Adams' \"Starship Titanic\", with its menagerie of eccentric automatons, and one puzzle involving a mechanical bartending machine with an organ-like keyboard on which buttons are pressed and keys played seemed as if it could have been right from that ill-fated spaceship. One very clever and beautiful gimmick is a sort of music box which when wound up performs a bit of backstory from the childhood of two of the central characters, which sequences segue between the music box display itself and flashbacks to \"real life\".\nGameplay itself is episodic, and you progress from one city to another on a full-size wind-up train with your mechanical engineer/conductor, Oscar, solving each segment of the game. Oscar generally proves of little help to you, as wherever you stop he is afraid to leave the train because of the windy/dusty/sooty/sandy climate outside. Your quest, as Kate Walker, is tracking down a certain Hans Voralberg, creator of all these wondrous automatons and machines, to obtain his signature on a contract. Spoiler -- you succeed. This climactic moment plays out in paradoxically anti-climactic fashion -- a moment, and it's done. Then -- ah, but then you get the REAL conclusion to the saga. While not especially surprising, there is a dramatic suddenness to it and a tension which grips the player -- although at this point we have stopped really playing and are watching a cutscene play out the game's last moments.\nOne small issue is sequentiality. A number of times I performed some task only to find, after, characters giving me clues or Kate herself saying something which made it seem that said task still needed to be done -- or conversely, making reference to something I did NOT know yet but in a way which indicated I already had discovered some fact. Another, perhaps larger issue, is that the characters here TALK and TALK and TALK. I understand that this is something of a characteristic of European games of this type. And the accents don't help. I've also seen complaints that it is TOO episodic, and there is little sense of continuity from the beginning to the end, and sequence to sequence. Although I understand the point, I largely disagree, or disagree, at least, that it is a negative: it's just how the game plays, and is no more episodic than Myst or any of the other classic graphic adventure games. However, I must concede that it lacks SOMETHING -- but I'm not sure what. The art and music are good -- the music in fact is outstanding at times, and a musical performance is one of the key events. Some of the cinematic sequences are close to breath-taking -- I'm thinking in particular of the launch of a rocket and the flight of an airship. But the whole thing is lacking a certain spark, that special magic that takes you out of yourself and into the game itself, makes you believe that you really are immersed in a different world. It doesn't ruin the game, not by far, don't misunderstand me -- but it keeps it out of that highest level of entertainment, achieving that true suspension of disbelief. Except -- except perhaps in that final cutscene. That's where it comes closest. And I think too that a lot of players in a way ignored that conclusion, and failed to realize that the heart of the story isn't about Kate finding an old man and getting his signature, the heart of the story is KATE HERSELF. Understand this, understand the final scenes, and I think you'll appreciate this a bit more. In any case, I am now eagerly awaiting Syberia 2 to finish downloading (also part of the Meridian Collection) and look forward to playing it as well. It is coincidence that I've just found that S3 has just been released, and the first reviews and comments I've seen are rather harsh, at least with regard to the English translation and voice-acting. At $40 I'll probably wait a while until it's a Steam Special -- but play it I will!\nSo bottom line here -- I DO recommend this -- somewhat tentatively, perhaps -- be prepared for a thoughtful, slow-paced ride with Kate, Oscar, and their friends & enemies. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but will be a rewarding and refreshing cup for some.", "hours": 25.1, "user_id": "76561197961993277", "username": "The Grey Piper", "products": 248, "early_access": false},

This one is pretty good and I think it's a great one to start out with if you're new to adventure games, because it has a good story and the problems are typically at a beginner level, without being absurdly easy.\nOne thing I particularly liked about the game is that it shows you very clearly what you can click on.  This is something that a lot of games lack.  I want to pull my hair out when I've been thinking and thinking about how to solve a problem in an adventure game and it turns out there was something I just didn't know I could click on (like a one-pixel wide item or something).  WIth Syberia, that's never an issue and it means that they can't rely on poorly thought-out solutions based on flailing around with the mouse to see what you can click on.\nMy only complaint is that there were a couple of places in which the solutions to problems were, in my opinion, not terribly intelligent.  I'm perfectly willing to take my hat off to a really clever problem that I didn't get, but it drives me nuts when these games have solutions that aren't at all clever, just non-sensical.  I'll try for hours only to give up, find an online walkthrough and then tear my hair out that the solution doesn't even make sense.  I'd advise that you don't spend too, too long on a problem you're stumped with.  Don't be ashamed to find online walkthroughs, because occasionally it's just that the problem was poorly designed.  Fortunately, those sorts of things are few and far between.\nThe plot is fairly original, centering around a scientist who made ingenious automata that do all sorts of amazing things and who was obsessed with the idea that wooly mammoths never died out, but still exist in some isolated part of the arctic.  My only complaint with the plot is that Syberia refers to a legendary place, not to Siberia, even though it could easily be somewhere around there.  Nobody once mentions that Syberia and Siberia are different (in fact, I don't think anyone even mentions Siberia at all) and yet, even when they're speaking orally, everyone seems to just get that Syberia means the legendary place, even though it's pronounced exactly the same. That little bit kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but, otherwise, it's quite well done and very creative.\nOne thing I particularly like is that you have a cell phone and you can make calls any time you want, though only to preexisting contacts, which you can add to as the game progresses.  I thought that was a nice touch.  You also get calls sometimes from people like your boss, who wants updates, and your mother and boyfriend who are both worried about you and want you to come home.\nAll in all, a good game.

Oh and gals; prepare to feel like you did in the 80's in terms of progressive female leads in the gaming industry.\nDisclaimer:  I'm completely shocked by 1. the copious positive reviews for this game, and 2. that the game was made in this century.  I love a good adventure game, but I'm struggling to find any lately, hence going back to some old ones and this was recommended in one of those lists, thank god I bought it on sale is all I can say at this point.   Also, it's circa 2005 with no autosave feature, I'm pretty sure other games had this by that point, what a wierd thing to not include?  Anyhow, here goes.\n+ves\nIt's pretty\nSome inventive puzzles\nInteresting storyline underneath the surperflous padding-out nonesense\n-ves\nBoring\nlacking in content and in stuff to do\nSome pretty outdated ideas of feminity - as in like a century out of date, whilst superficially trying to appear modern.\nNeedlessly drawn out game play:  animations, dialogue, spread out environments - STAIRS!\nNo maps in really convulted areas\nToo much boring dialogue\nUnskippable animations\nMore on stairs - Kate has a serious almost crippling phobia of them it seems\nSoap opera side plot which ironically provides an excellent example of why the Bechdel test is so important\nIt's really wierd for me to bring this up as it's not really been an issue since the 80's - I've been gaming since I was 7 which was in 1988, and although some games may have some superficial problems with sexism (GTO being the worst offender, and not superfical about it either), most games by this point are far, FAR more inclusive than they were back then.  My biggest gripe with this as a female gamer is that the femminist revolution seems to be something that happened somewhere else - if the writting here is anything to go by at least.  As most of us are aware this occurred in the 60's, yet the protaganist has this strange twee way of speaking, more akin to the 19th or early 20th century.  Then there's what she's saying;  and we are supposed to believe that this woman is a lawyer?!  She spends the entire game being submissive, impassive and the entire point of her existence seems to be for her boyfriend or boss; both of whom are petulant children who need to be told to ♥♥♥♥ off, like now.  How the hell did this gal get through law school?  The side plot revolving around this is hilariously predictable and the culmination is as dull as its content.  It gets worse, the women in her life can't even get the game passed the Bechdel test (yes they only talk about Kate's boyfriend and boss) - it strikes me as stereotypical female drama (think rom-coms, I ♥♥♥♥ing hate rom-coms) as seen through the eyes of a man, a man most likely born in the 40's - it's somewhere between complete ignorance and straight up contempt.  And I don't know whether this is more confusing for me or the guy that wrote this, it's just frigging wierd.  Even by the time our protagist shrugs off the shackles that is her peer group (spoiler not spoiler - its at the end), you'll stil want to smack her in the face.  Grow a pair of ovaries love, seriously, you're embaressing the rest of us.  Then there's her personality - she's all over the place, and it doesn't really represent the unimaginative arc she's given;  Which I think is, a woman finds herself by being thrown in to a wierd adventure and in doing so realises that she can't keep sacrificing herself for what others expect and demand of her, and finally - but not really - she tells them all to do one.\nWhat about the mechanics?  Aaaaarrrrrghhhhh!  Kate will run if you double click, this is one of the few elements this game has incorportated from more modern adventure games.  However there is no screen wrapping and every time you hit some stairs (and yes they are all over the place), kate stops suddenly as if she's come to a precipice, she then painstakingly prepares herself like an elderly person due for a hip raplcement at the bottom of said stairs, before  ardously climbing them: I'm pretty sure people pass kidney stones quicker than this.  Then there's the inventory system which is clumbsy and no you cannot combine items.  And there's the bugs, I had two crashes for no reason, and if you alt tab to say your media player on your second monitor, the background graphics get knocked out until you change scenary and trust me; you will want to watch something whilst playing this, in order to quench the sheer monotonous boredom.   You will also have to restrict the game to 256 colour in the game.exe properties in order to get it to run on win X (and most likely any OS later than XP).  Finally, beware of the huge amount of content in the form of diaries etc, as it's all as excruciatingly dull and verbose as the verbal conversations and adds very little to the story or as clues for puzzles.\nPuzzles?  I can barely remember them as they are completely overshadowed by the extremely slow pacing, there were some good ones in there (I think), but the spread out environments really hurt them and are clearly another exercise in dragging the game time out.  Then there's the multitiude of unskippable animations to conversations or interactions with certain objects, it passes bordering on the ridiculous after about an hour of gameplay.  Of those puzzle's I can remember some are very poorly implemented.  For example, there's one involving a blood sample that I had to read a walkthrough for as the game gives you only one way obtaining the second sample and if you miss it and do what most people would do, you will not be able to fix it and proceed - I ended up going back a save and found that the missed option is only noticiable when you are looking for it and does not in anyway resemble the way the first sample is obtained.  This is not an isolated example and it amounts to some lazy writting and design imo.\nOther problems:  The reading, oh my god the reading, there's so much and its written so, so, so badly.  The only time where the dialogue seemed less twee was in a diary, but that's only because it starts in the early 20th century!  The voice acting is nativity play calibre, and that comparison might actually be more insulting to the children.  To make matters worse these uninspired conversations go on for what seems like longer than the aforementioned diary, and they are all frigging terrible.  I wonder whether the acting would be so bad if the actors weren't so clearly directed to speak so ♥♥♥♥ing slowly.  You will roll your eyes to the point of muscle strain.\nIf you're new to adventure games, I'm again recommending the Broken Sword series, Discworld Noir and more recently Still life.  The modernised telltale fair are pretty good too although I would definitely avoid The walking Dead Michone series and Game of thrones, as they are also boring and eye roll inducing.  The rest of the TWD are great and ignore the horror porn comments about the female protaganist in the second season and frontier, cos guess what?   Kids go though some serious♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes and I dont think it helps anyone by shying away from that reality, especially when talking about a sodding zombie apocolypse!  The wolf among us and Life is strange however, put most of these to shame, so save them for last as they may spoil you in terms of expectations in other games of this ilk.\nThis however, kill it, kill it with fire.", "hours": 22.4, "user_id": "76561198090234171", "username": "penfoldini", "products": 125, "early_access": false},

The content is comparable to modern story DLCs where the final chapter of a game is seperated from the main storyline and is sold seperately. Syberia II doesn't work well as a standalone, and it isn't accomodating to new players who didn't play the first game; the story is a hodgepodge without proper context from Syberia.

Overall, it's not a bad game, but don't get your expectations too high or you'll just be disappointed at the end.\n:\n*For fans of Syberia, the game ends in a very satisfying manner and Kate's wanderlust has proven to be worth it\nthe journey towards their goal is so drab and boring. Side characters have no lasting impact on both Kate and Hans, the antagonists are comical, and key plot points reveal in an unsatisfying manner. Syberia II just didn't work for me since this game is all about fulfilling an agenda, rather than satiating Kate's desires of discovering herself, and expanding the mythos surrounding Hans Voralberg.\n*The backtracking had been minimized considerably\n\npuzzles are so obscure and complex, you have to scour every inch of the levels and read every note to find the solution, making the player backtrack a lot, regardless of the improvements made to counter that. True story: I never consulted guides during my playthrough of Syberia, but Syberia II prompted me to do otherwise.\nAnd there you have it.", "hours": 20.0, "username": "SoI|dCentur|0", "products": 289, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

I first played it many, many years ago and, since then, have replayed it several times since. Each time I replay reminds me of why I fell in love in the first place.\nIt is the story that took me. It seem strange at first because the graphics isn't that good, the voice acting isn't the best, and the dialogue can be downright awful at times. You'd think all these factors would make the story difficult to get into...and it certainly doesn't help, that's for sure. However, I suppose what I love is the premise, the imagery, the location, and how it is all executed together.\nOften, while playing through this game, I get a sense of surrealism. At times, I get drawn into the quaint loveliness of the architecture and people of Valadilene/Barrockstadt then the stark barrenness of Komkolzgrad/Aralbad, and, in the midst of this, the inexplicable impossible spring-operated automatons would be present. It's a weird mixture, but it somehow drew me in. I would feel as if I'm actually in a fantasy world exploring it.\nKind of a strange thing to feel considering that's pretty much what many games essentially is and aims to make players feel. Problem is that it seems to be so rarely achieved. In fact, of the hundreds of games I've played over the course of my life, Syberia is among a handful that actually manages to achieve it.\nFor that reason alone, I became a huge fan and the game gets my highest recommendation possible.", "hours": 37.1, "username": "MarioTGreat", "products": 164, "early_access": false},

As a widely recommended title of my favourite genre, it's full of original ideas, beautiful artwork and the opening scene made me feel like I was in for a real treat. The music's nice too. Looking through the Steam reviews you're hard pushed to find a bad one. Unfortunately, as much as I kept trying to love this game, it really didn't work for me.\nSadly, my defining memory of this game won't be the ever-increasing innovation of Hans Voralberg's automatons or the sheer time and effort spent on complimenting the plot via newspaper clippings, diary entries and so on. Instead, I'll remember the tedious and seemingly endless running back and forth involved EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. And I should point out that I mean the word 'step' quite literally.\nI'm not sure exactly what happened to Kate Walker in the days or weeks preceding the game that makes climbing stairs such a challenge for her but as she slowly and deliberately positions herself at the bottom of even the smallest flight, before beginning her tortuous ascent, you can't help but try and solve the only truly baffling puzzle of the whole adventure - If a woman walking up some stairs is so disruptive to the game's engine then WHY PUT STAIRS IN EVERY FRAME?!\nSolving a puzzle invariably involves walking back and forth through a bunch of frames multiple times in what felt to me like a shameless attempt to make the game feel as though it contains more gameplay than it really does. Don't get me wrong, I've played many point and click games in my time and know that running back and forth between frames to solve puzzles is a characteristic almost all share, but usually this is a case of necessity rather than choice and developers usually try to make it as painless as possible. In Syberia, the designers seem to have brainstormed on the question 'How can we make this game seem longer than it is?' and come up with only one solution; 'Drag every puzzle out as long as is humanly possible until finding the solution is more of a relief than a reward'.\nMy primary frustrations with this game are as follows:\n- In some scenes you can double-click to make Kate run. In others, for some unknown reason, you can't. This gets quite annoying.\n- Unneccesary and, more importantly, unskippable animations precede interactions with NPC's, which makes returning to someone you've already spoken to for a quick recap a painfully slow process. The same goes for interacting with objects.\n- It's impossible to skip to the next frame with a double-click, a simple feature which would have multiplied my enjoyment of the game ten-fold.\n- It takes a long time for NPC's to say anything that might be of value in some of the most wooden dialogue I've ever witnessed in a point and click game.\nIn short, it takes AGES to do ANYTHING. A simple puzzle that requires little thought and would be solved in seconds in better designed games (ANY Lucasarts title for example) ends up taking minutes to complete which really adds up over the course of the adventure.\nThis review may seem harsh but I feel that the reviews on Steam are so unfairly one-sided that a counteracting review is necessary to warn people that the slow, tedious gameplay mentioned in some of the other reviews as a potential downfall really IS enough to ruin the entire experience.\nSorry, Syberia. There were so many times when you were so close to being a great, original game but you screwed up at every opportunity by disregarding the one thing that all great games have in common: The continued engagement of the player.\nIf you consider yourself to be a particularly patient person who doesn't mind spending a five minutes running for every minor hunch that you have then buy this game and enjoy the good things about it. As for me, despite having bought both Syberia 1 & 2 together, I won't be playing the second one until I've finished watching all of my paint dry.

It's a truly memorable classic which helped revive the genre at the time. I remember when I first learned about Syberia, the idea of a plot involving automatons and mammoths didn't excite me, but I was very curious how it all tied together. This is a slow-moving, story-heavy game with strong atmosphere and a beautiful, haunting soundtrack, as lawyer Kate Walker heads east through Europe to find an eccentric inventor. and close a business deal. In many ways this game is about Kate's character development, and you can't help but to go through the experience with her. The game seems to take place around the time it was created (2002) but as you visit the locations, touched with elements of art nouveau, steampunk, and the scars of world war, the game feels enchanting, surreal, and totally out of time in the most endearing way. The intelligent script, mysterious and charming, has it's moments of suspense and humor, too.\nNow, the puzzles to be found are somewhat straight forward and will likely give you no trouble. So this isn't a puzzle-centric adventure, which may push some people away. Also, the game has been criticized for having many screens where there's nothing to interact with as you move between points of interest. I can understand that running through 4 screens of landscape at a time with nothing to do, and then running back through them, can be irritating to some people. However, I find this is something that contributes to the immersive and thoughtful tone of the game, like looking at paintings.\nI should mention that while this is the must-play gem of the series, the shorter sequel is still very good, and the 3rd game, developed 13 years later and coming out next month, will no doubt be interesting.", "hours": 7.9, "user_id": "76561198029006705", "username": "Aegrum", "products": 483, "early_access": false},

As an adventure game, it also turned up the puzzle difficulty, sometimes significantly.\nSyberia II is, from beginning to end, one large journey, continuing straight from the ending scene of the previous game. Once again, we participate in a long trip of the returning protagonist, Kate Walker and the mysterious heir she chased all the way through the first game, Hans Voralberg.\nSyberia II is a sentimental tale, where the theme of the first game has matured into such questions as how long would someone go to fulfil their old dreams before their days run out, and how one can re-evaluate their purpose in life when they find a cause worthy enough to leave everything behind.\nAs with most stories full of allegories, it is very slow and very dreamlike. The scenery reflects how our protagonists gradually leave the edge of civilisation as the last post of humanity, a small post-Soviet barter town fades into the distance of the vast Russian tundra, where the end of the tracks may hold the answer in their search of the last resting place of the remaining mammoths, the mythical island called Syberia.\nThe game uses another tool to let the players immerse themselves in its world and atmosphere besides the slow pacing: the puzzles. They don’t use the warped point ‘n’ click logic that ruined many great games, but many of them rely on trial and error or constantly travelling from one end of a large gameplay area to another. The last third of the plot is especially notorious, where the difficulty quickly rises to almost legendary levels.\nBut all that hardship will be worth it.

What a disappointment it is and a big one at that.\nYou play as Kate Walker, a lawyer. You travel to a little town in Europe to the mission of completing a deal to buy a Toy Factory which actually makes automatons, which seem like robots but a little different as the game explains it, or tries because it doesn’t really explain it. Here we can begin pointing out one of the first of the many problems of the game, nothing is explained to you.\nThe developers create a setting that is different from the usual, so if anything they should try to immerse you in it. One good way to do it would be to explain to you how some of these particular things are, how they work or pretty much anything interesting about it but no, better to be left in the dark, I guess.\nThe story itself is boring and bland. Without spoiling anything while trying to settle the deal for the purchase of this factory you learn about some of the history of some characters. Bare in mind that those characters are either dead or you have not yet met them. To give the game a little credit, this is by far the best part of the game, the backstory of what happened years ago. Of course the game wouldn’t present it to you in a interesting manner, that would be asking too much, instead you are presented with a book to read. About 10 pages or more. It’s not that bad but as it is the best part of the game and the only thing that gives context to many of the stuff that you see and some puzzles one would thing they would do a better job at presenting it.\nWith a boring scenario and story that leaves us to the characters and I’m sorry to say, they’re also just as bad. First, your main character, Kate Walker. She is alright at best. You don’t get much room to see her being relatable but at least she’s not annoying not anything. There are however some things that could make her seems better as everynow and then you get a cellphone during the game as people in your life want to talk to you, be it your boss, boyfriend, friend or mother. The problem here is that when talking to pretty much any of these people, when you think it would help to create Kate’s character, it does, but in an opposite way one would hope. Everyone gets the last word with her, it almost makes you feel sorry for her being kind of stupid and helpless and aside from her friend, every person that calls her seem boring.\nThere are also the characters you meet which believe or not are even worse. One of the first characters you have to interact with is a retar... mentally disabled kid which tags along with you for while and you can guess how much depth he has… zero. This only goes on and on with every character which are boring to the extreme with the sole exception being the robot/automatron Oscar. He seems to be the only interesting and creative character of the game and lo and behold, the only interesting character in a point and click adventure game is a robot. Not your character, not anyone you meet but a robot.\n\nWhat music? It seems the game does have some music but it barely plays. Most of the time you are walking around in a complete silence with only the marvelous sound of your footsteps. Occasionally some music does play and it is beautiful but it’s so rare you barely forget there is any music for about 90% of the time you’re playing.\n\nThe environments do have a nice mood to it. They look nice, of course, understanding this game is some years old but despite of that, the game does look nice. What its’t nice, however, is that every item, door, or pretty much anything you have to interact seem to be hidden behind some huge amount  of crap in the front of it or some horrible camera angles that obscures anything worth noting. I do appreciate when developers take the care to not make items stand out so much they are almost shinning in contrast to the background but here they made sure to make it virtually invisible. Most items you can only probably notice when mousing over them, otherwise you would probably miss them entirely.\nWith all that out of the way, it leaves us to gameplay and partially continuing what I was saying about the graphics, when you can’t see anything in a point and click game, you can imagine how the gameplay is gonna be like. This is the killer for me. Everything is a pixel hunt and that only helps to make the gameplay slow.\nTalking about slow, how about mentioning the movement speed our main characters walks? Let me just say, it’s so slow you can probably do something else while she walks from screen to screen and to add to it, there are a ton of screen to walk around with barely anything worthwhile to do, look, or experience. It seems like it’s padding to make the game seem longer than it actually should be.\nIn fact, it seems like every action Kate does is in slow motion, like climbing a set of stairs, for example. Depending of the stairs they seem to take about 5 to 15 seconds just so she can climb it and another 15 seconds to climb back down. Did I mention there’s a ton of backtracking in this game. Well, then get ready to have fun walking super slow back and forth and waiting for the slowest of the animations to get anywhere.\nOnly thing left to mention is the puzzles and by god, they are among the worst I’ve seen. Most of them feel like they are completely random, especially when you are giving pretty much zero indication about how to proceed. Recently I’ve heard of the term\nand I think it is the perfect way to express my perception of the puzzles in Syberia. They have no logic one could think of unless they lived in the moon or maybe the crazy world from Alice in Wonderland.\n\nI’ve played games that take a while to begin, many adventure games and visual novels suffer from that, the problem with Syberia is that it never gets anywhere. I love puzzle games when they have some thought put into them. Sometimes, you play a game in this genre but one of its aspects leaves something to be desired, a game may have some weird puzzles but a good story, bad story but with good characters, weird characters but nice music, etc. The problem with Syberia is that for me it did everything wrong.\nIf you would like to see my other reviews, please,", "hours": 4.6, "username": "DiMenezes", "products": 308, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

The soundtrack also deserves praises, it complements well the settings and help create an ambiance. For the time I spent on this game, I forgot everything about my (boring) adult life and joyfully went on an adventure with Kate Walker.\nOn the downside, Syberia is pretty short (it took me 6 hours to finish it) and has close to no replay value as most enigmas are straightforward and none of them is randomly generated. Because of that, it is worth waiting for this game to be on sales and/or buy it as part of the Syberia bundles. Also it uses Comic Sans MS as main font but I could survive; this misstep was probably done to balance the eye-candy sceneries.\nI hope that at some point in the future they will do a true remake of Syberia with true 4K resolution and additional enigmas.", "hours": 6.4, "username": "-EpicFail-", "products": 159, "early_access": false},

For a player like me who searches games mainly for the story this was perfect. The puzzles are mostly sensible and you can figure them out with brain work, most of them are even very fun to do. They don't take too long and what's best, you CAN'T mess things up so that you would need to reload. Always a plus for a puzzle game, because many times I forget to save the progress for hours, sucks to reload in that point :D\nAs for the downside, there are also puzzles that make no sense, or the game does not hint you about the solutions in any way, you just have to try differet combinations. Some puzzles also depend on finding certain objects, which can be a nuisance because there is no glimmer, noticeable vivid colours on pickable objects, etc. that would make it easier. Sometimes you end up hoovering your mouse over a scene in hope of finding the right thing to do.

We are introduced by a notable cast that includes the dead all along character (the early reveal of Anna Vozerberg’s funeral), the mouthy kid (Momo) who is referred to as the ‘village idiot’, and the hotel manager. The hero/heroine in which we are playing as is, if not obvious enough, will be the great detective of the case. Apart from this main set of characters, many of the other NPCs you come across will mainly be fillers.\nVoice acting was a nice addition to the game, especially for Miss Walker. It gives us a better feel for our characters persona, and enhances the interactive nature to this game.\nThe art is absolutely stunning. A great amount of detail and texture was added to the rooms, objects and overall settings and it was rich in the steampunk genre. Anyone who enjoyed the design of similar games like Amnesia, or Alice: Madness Returns will agree on that. This includes the smooth effects in the atmosphere, such as smoke, breeze and other animations that occur during the cut scenes or when you interact with an object.\nThe BGM and sound effects were also well done.

Like its predecessor, the game is set in a post-Soviet backdrop of unspecified geography and features various locations ranging from a Russian mining town, a Monastery, and Subarctic forests, to Youkol settlements and even a dream-trance state of Valadilène (the town from the first game) through all of  which the player guides Walker throguh many difficulties of their journey.\nThe plot, straightforward as it appears, features many details regarding Hans' obsessions, as well as Kate's former life, flesh out the storyline. There is an underlining theme of the Hans' quest comes across as one of almost prophetic proportions, which lends the game an odd mixture of magical realism tinged by the Art Nouveau-themes steampunk of many locations.\nThe user interface is slightly cluncky and direction arrows may get slightly confusing at times. The same applies for the interface on puzzles: the game features only one icon for interaction (a magnifying lens) regardless of the nature or the direction of the said interaction. While this doesn't prevent puzzles from being solved (as they're not impossibly difficult anyway), it does nonetheless lack intutivity.\nOverall, Syberia II provides a fitting conclusion to Benoît Sokal's great duology (soon to be a trilogy, apparently). Its simple combination of a beautiful plot with elegant artwork makes Syberia II a necessary addition to adventure game collections even after more than a decade of its release.", "hours": 12.0, "user_id": "76561198059861937", "username": "Mirus", "products": 216, "early_access": false},

If I'd bought them individually, I wouldn't have bothered with part 2, as part 1 put me to sleep. Even after I gave up and watched a Let's Play instead, THAT put me to sleep. To be fair, 2 is a little less narcolepsy-inducing, but not enough for me to keep going beyond ALMOST getting out of the first area.\nIt's rather discouraging, because the reviews are overwhelmingly positive otherwise. Why do so many other people enjoy what feels like a very pretty but dull exploration game? Because that's what it feels like--the \"puzzles\" are a bit obtuse (having spent far too long trying to figure out the basic controls during part 1), and much of the solutions are just find SOMETHING to interact with and try everything. It's not even enjoyable watching Kate Walker... walk... and walk... and walk... and walk BACK... etc. I can think of so many games that have a world that FEELS larger in fewer screens, just because the amount of interactive content per \"room\" is so much higher, and the attention to details that convey character in and of themselves. Syberia overall has a lot of empty content for really no reason other than I guess the art department planned out a map and the programmers worked around that. At least in part 2 there are fewer doors for Kate to declare she won't even bother trying to open.\nFurthermore, I realized that what I don't like about this style of point-and-click game is the \"distant\" feel of the characters. Every dialogue is from at least twenty feet away, perspective-wise, so it's more like eavesdropping than actual interaction. There are no close-ups (other than the shadowy cutscenes in part 2), so I get no feel for the characters' emotions except through the (kinda bad) translated voice-acting, because they're as stiffly animated as puppets. The closest it got to providing any depth or emotion was how part 1 kept interrupting what little gameplay there was with random phone calls that only served to show how much nobody really respected Kate, while part 2 took a different tack and put in sorely-needed cinematics (that seemed to inflate Kate's importance far above and beyond her original \"buy a toy factory\" job... but then I fell asleep through half the story to fully appreciate the drama).\nIt's not like 3D can't accommodate the kind of character animation that 2D can provide easily--just look at any Telltale Games game (Sam & Max, The Wolf Among Us) or even a game like Ankh or the Gabriel Knight 20th Anniversary remake... though the GK remake admittedly feels as clunky as Syberia, the interview sections and cutscenes still draw the player out of \"watch from a distance like a creepy stalker\" mode enough to convey a real sense of who the characters are.\nYes, I get that they were going for this realistic world to explore, and they've done a good job of that. Once I've seen a room once, though, it gets boring seeing it about fifty more times in trying to progress the story.\ntl;dr: Just watch a walkthrough on Youtube, it's a lot less clicking.", "hours": 6.1, "username": "Minzoku Bokumetsu", "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Those related to Kate Walker will call her often and serve no purpose to the story.

MOST puzzles are \"A puzzle has occured and its/or person is missing Object A, now get to walking or talking to get said Object A, then spam all dialogue options to solve the puzzle.\"\n-Because most of the puzzles are like this, you'll be backtracking alot. My issue with this is the majority of the environments are sooo bland in appearance it makes it an eye and mindnumbing chore when backtracking.\n-Music is nice, but it drove me insane after being in certain chapters for long periods. Reason is because no matter what location you are in in a particular chapter (hotel, factory, cave, church, cemetary etc.) the same song will continue looping and playing. When you begin another chapter, the song will change, but the new song will be the ONE AND ONLY song that you'll be hearing over and over until you complete that chapter.

It was either phrased in a different way, it missed a few words, added a few words... nothing that was important for understanding the story, but it was odd, and I don't see how they couldn't find someone to accurately transcribe the dialogue. It doesn't matter if you are listening to it with volume, like I did, but I found it weird.\n-Running a round was a liiiiittle bit slow when I was backtracking for no reason or running around trying to figure out what to do, but not enough to be annoying.\n-The game as a whole is not extremely fast-paced, but it really depends on what kind of person you are + what you want out of a game. It kind of works with the type of game and the story, but some (the impatient?) might find it too slow and thus boring.\nAs a sequal, it gets points for staying true to the original and continuing on with its story without a hitch. It feels identical in almost every way, albiet is even more exciting because you're reaching the end of your journey and seeing even more interesting people and places.\nAll-around, it was a great game for me. Whether it's the right game for you I can't say, but if you have a history of point-and-click, mystery games, and adventure games, it's generally so cheap to get these games (they might even show up in a cheap pack -- that's how I got them), that if you think you might be into it, you aren't losing much by giving it a shot. Some games I also have enjoyed that I think have some similarities, though none are exactly the same:\nNancy Drew\nThe Hardy Boys\nAnd Then There Were None - Agatha Christie\nMysterious Island\nMyst\nRiven", "hours": 17.1, "username": "Arrow", "products": 174, "early_access": false},

Maybe my hopes were too high after some of the great level designs in Syberia 1, but these levels felt uninspired.\n-Puzzles were not as satisfying as Syberia 1.  I found the puzzles in this one to be more tedious than enjoyable.\n-The sense of mystery from Syberia 1 is gone.  You already know a lot from what you discovered in Syberia 1, and there's really no mystery added.  This game is pretty much just about getting from point A to point B.  It kind of feels like filler.\n-The new characters were mostly bland, and the game's antagonist is just annoying.\n-No spoilers, but I was not completely happy with the plot.\n-As with Syberia 1, the game just ends with no real ending or sense of resolution.

In all honesty, while I get that devs wanted to add a flavour of challenge, the game would have done MUCH better without these.

Oftentimes you get stuck because you missed a doorway or a box of crates in some remote corner. Ugh. I really recommend keeping an FAQ at hand... 2) Especially because the puzzles can be really opaque and strange. Some of the puzzles are very logical and satisfaying.

A very good game,too, but nothing more from the original.\nThe Graphics here are a bit better and it has to be the resolution. The original was probably made in 800x600 and Syberia 2 in 1024x768. If not then the textures are better. But there is a great difference in the look. This game is full cinematic too. Of course, it will never look as a modern game.. That's why a remake HAS to be made.\nVoices and sounds are exceptional and of culture.\nThe riddle system is supposed to be the same. But the game instead of the first one has some tiresome riddles without meaning. If you found yourself stucked you may have missed something obvious. The bad thing with the game is that the places have great range and are many. Without the option to change a place instantly by double-clicking on the door that you find in modern games, missing something is totally tiresome. And in this game you'll find many cases that you missed something because there is NO hot spot help as an old game it is. So, the game is NOT difficult at all. You just have to look all around the areas you go carefully.\nThe landscapes still are great but because of the resolution I couldn't make a screenshot. But they are really amazing! You'll find yourself in a world based on north Russia in the start of the game and later on who really knows,to an eskimos(we could call them) village below the ice and in the frozen seas of the Arctic Ocean. When finally you find your destination the landscapes look as those of Amerzone(Jungle) another Benoit Sokal's game.\nThe story continues from the original.It still is between reality and fantastic with more focus in reality. You'll get across different civilizations and you'll be through their culture in medicine, life, gods and many more. It's really good for a successor to keep you up. Believe me. At this point you'll never been bored. Just try NOT to miss things like we said...\nA GREAT successor to the original.

Although the theme of the story doesn't seem special at all, the developer must be complimented for building a haunting gameplay upon it. Elements of longing, mysticism, fantasy, and mystery are well-blended, and will make you want to play further and further. Dialogues are well-written and entertaining. Visuals are dated and nothing special. While playing it on a 24\" 1080p monitor wasn't a great experience – the blurry edges around all objects were quite visible – my enjoyment of the game wasn't impeded in any sense. Puzzles are quite straight-forward, and don't require any critical thinking skills; just be alert to your surroundings at all times, and pay special attention to all objects that your character can interact with, for be assured, such objects will have some use in the game.\nThe only irritant – a big one – in the game is its tedious gameplay. Your character will need to walk around a lot in order to solve puzzles and find things and NPCs. All that could've easily been bypassed by making the character appear at the location of interest with a single click. But no! The sadistic game designers make you watch as the character meanders her way to the desired location, which will make you terribly impatient and peeved, and you might even turn-off the game in anger...only to return a few hours later :).\nSCORE: 7/10 (3 points deducted for tedious gameplay, average visuals, and unintelligent game design)\nPS: To play the complete story, you will need to play this game\nSyberia, the first episode that sells as a separate game. However,  if, for some reason, you decide to play this game only, you will be briefed about what happened in the first episode via an option in the main menu.

She follows his footprints in awe and searches for him for her own answers.\nI strongly suggest playing this game if you enjoy a good story. You'll be hooked and you won't want to stop.

With rare but existing weird pronounciation in both, the English and the German version, the heart of this game lies in the impressive achievements of Hans Voralberg, an ingenious savant engineer, who left home in search for a legendary land called Syberia.\nThe story is quite charming (or the premise, at least), though, its protagonist not too believable: I think Kate Walker makes the (greatly appreciated) personality changes – from obedient to self-confident – for the wrong reasons, resulting in a superficiality based on unhealthy selfishness that I don't like. Every so often she will receive a call on her cell phone from her boss, friend, boyfriend or mother, which stops Kate in her tracks for a few moments, for a dialog sequence. In these dialog scenes she arguably distances herself from these people more and more as the story goes on.\nI was especially angry about Kate (or rather the, I'm assuming, unintentionally misogynistic developers) for one particular puzzle: the dam. It is here where she can't cross a waist-high river – why can't she cross it? Waist-high is not that deep. Afraid of getting a bit wet? Oh well … \"Oooh, that stick is too dirty. I won't carry it.\" … And ultimately the scene where she says: \"I can't push the lever, I need help.\" – and then she goes and gets the boy Momo to do it *for* her instead of *with* her. Ugh … That whole puzzle was just awfully executed, imo.\nAll that crap aside however, the overall atmosphere is pretty mellow. You've got many \"rooms\" with nothing to do but walk through in order to get to the actually (gameplay-wise) interesting places; \"rooms\" where you can enjoy the chirping birds and nice vistas. Running around and repairing \"broken\" automatons by simply winding them up again feels kinda mellow, too – not that the puzzles are dull or too easy! It just *feels* mellow because, once wound up, the machines work as intended and \"do the work for you\". They do *different* work than what you had to do to get them working … *sigh* nevermind.\nI think that the areas explorable from the get-go (in each chapter) are rather vast and can be easily overwhelming, although it's all manageable if you don't rush it. Unfortunately however, the game has many, many clickable doors where all Kate will say is: \"I don't need to go there.\" That's, in this amount, unnecessary and, quite frankly, a bit annoying.\nThe context-sensitive GUI can be a bit confusing at first due to icons too hard to distinguish. I wish they had made the speech bubble a filled circle instead of a ring, I feel like that would've helped a lot. Other than that it is a nice fitting simplistic style choice that I can get behind.\nAs for the dialog system, the game uses rigid topics to choose from – which, in some conversations, don't make much sense. But it works most of the times. And maybe I'm spoiled by today's games but … the similarly rigid \"sequential animation chains\" that sometimes occur can be a pain to watch and endure. For instance, Kate walking up a flight of stairs: first center position, then walk cycle, then sometimes popping, finally \"release\" back to interactivity. Just make sure not to use stairs too often.\nIt's a good game, but I don't know if I would recommend playing it without the sequel as an immediate follow-up.\n[7.o/1o.o]", "hours": 14.4, "compensation": "Product received for free", "username": "WoodrowShigeru", "products": 222, "early_access": false},

The puzzles are also a bit harder, but not very difficult, even though some of them require a lot of observation and attention to details. So if everything is better, why I didn't gave a 10 to Syberia II, well, it's because of the puzzles, not because I found them too difficult or too easy, but because sometimes their simplicity is hidden by stupid details, like for example the radar puzzle to eject Kate, it was so simple, but the fact that first we used some numbers to contact the colonel, induced me in error thinking that the puzzle is difficult and that I have to do some calculations, all because the first numbers that I used to contact the colonel had no relevance to the radar display whatsoever, while the second numbers that I needed to find where related to the radar display. Also there are other puzzles that can induce you in error and you can waste a lot of time because they need another puzzle to be completed first and it's quite difficult to know that.

It was a recommendation I got from a friend when I was still an undergrad over 10 years ago.. I love narrative-driven games and this one was both satisfying...and not. I loved  the first part, the village and exploring the factory most, it was  then that I had a sense of grand imagination along with an unfortunate story of Hans and Anna that intrgued me and kept me on my toes at first, but later that last part precisely wore off, that magic disappeared.\nThe first chapter on Kate's joruney was what I loved, but as the journey wore on,  the quest lost its charm for me. I still loved the wonderful backstories of Hans and Anna, the  cosmodrome character, the automatons, the three rectors in Barrockstadt, the short-sighted soldier at the Wall, the singer, and the mining complex director. But the journey itself  gradually lost its emotive and imaginative appeal, even though overall I can say it was really tightly woven, stringing together a variety of worlds, histories and traditions.\nI don't really like  Kate's backstory, too cliched - this sharp lawyer transforms on the journey blah blah, seen it all too many times, only cliched things happen in her life,  she's even got a thoroughly cliched \"fiance\", and their fate is painfully cliched.. Urgh, I was really annoyed by that. It didnt't really contribute anything for me, not to Kate's apparent \"change\" or anything, it was just an annoying cliche and her attitude is so nonchalant to her  friends and family, too indifferent, it really felt like she was a robot or something. I would have wished for someting more ambitious to develop Kate and make her seem more rounded.  This just was extremely trite and it made me dislike Kate.\nThe story was my main motivation to buy it, and I was half happy but in the end I felt it fell short of my expectations set out by the first part in particular and the sense of great wonder I started out with.  I was really happy with all the well developed, touching and sad backstories of the characters she interacted with, but her own background wasn't remotely interesting in all this, her friendship with Oscar was interesting, but also lacked something, maybe it's Kate's personality, I don't really like her all that much and she failed to make me want to cheer for her in any way. I was very indifferent towards her and the quest in the end. She didn't feel rounded enough, it felt like she was just a cliched female \"badass\", a trope I really despise, I am prejudiced unfavourably against this cliche, she felt too cardboard and one dimensional in all this, and not rounded enough. Yes, an adventure heroine should be resorceful and strong, that's fine but she was really too one-dimensional for me. I didn't feel  like she \"changed\" in any way. She said she did, but it wasn't convincing, it felt dry on top of the major annoying cliche.  I suppose her ending decision- just as typical for american movies- was a sign of some change but it failed to be convincing enough for me.\nThe other plus  are absolutely stunning environments and locations, some filled with a sense of desolation, others with a  sense of wonder and curiosity. It's a gorgeously set game, and it's a shame that story didn't, to me, give them full justice.\nOverall I recommend it. Maybe playing part 2 will make me change my mind. I loved the stories of the npcs but Kate herself, well i just don't feel connected to her and it's probably why the journey..tired me a little in the end.  couldn;t connect with her and she was slightly overlooked as a character to me, given a treatment that felt completely cliched. I was reluctant to journey with someone I don't like much., she's completely not my style. Maybe if she had a little more depth..\nBut I love the some of the ideas and the stories of the side characters and the settings and the early part of the story in particular. The automaton factory and the garden cave are probably my two favourite locations and the Barrockstadt station as well as  the cosmodrone. They were worlds within worlds. That' absolutely amazing. I love, love the locations, but emotional impact of the journey felt short in the end and left me dissatisfied.  Something was misisng, something became too cliched, something became too dry.\nin each location you do have to backtrack quite a bit sometimes, it can become tedious when you are narratve-focused since the tasks are fairly mundane but you have to do them to move forward ad some times something actually inttrguing or puzzling did come up in those mundane subtasks.  Each location has a series of subtasks that lead you to location goal.  I loved a few, I loved visiting the church for instance and doing the subquests there, I loved getting the band stand started in Barrockstadt, I also loved putting together Oscar's legs. I loved the voice cylinders and some of the cinematic sequences with them -  also gorgeous, and well presented pieces of Hans and Anna story.\nMy score is 75/100, it's an amazing game and definitely a good purchase but falls short on story for me a little, does not delivver the emotional impact I had expected.", "hours": 8.6, "username": "GameswithaHeart", "products": 63, "early_access": false},

I picked this up on sale for $3, and I have to say that this game is worth more than that; my 19 hours spent playing it had been one of the best experiences that I've had in gaming. The story is great, and it really caught my attention from the beginning, keeping me glued to my seat just to see what happens next. There's an absolute charm to be found in Syberia, and the attention to detail in regards to the cast's dialogue and personalities made the game stand out.\nThe story follows Kate Walker: an American lawyer who was sent by her firm to the French town of Valadilene to settle a huge deal. She was tasked with obtaining the signature of one Anna Voralberg in order to complete an American company's takeover of the once renowned Voralberg factory: makers of world-class automatons. The problem is, Anna Voralberg has been dead for a couple of days before Kate arrived and she is now forced to stay and find a supposed heir, leading her to a quest to find a man known as Hans Voralberg.\nSyberia is quite simple in terms of gameplay. It's your standard point-and-click with puzzle solving and detective elements; it has nothing groundbreaking to offer and its main draw lies in its simplicity. Unlike its peers, the game is pretty straightforward, and you won't get lost and have problems on where to go next or what puzzles to solve, despite having some very expansive areas. Difficulty-wise, the puzzles range from mundane to having the right amount of challenge, and since the game incorporates elements of steampunk, expect some weird and cooky contraptions to tinker with. The protagonist even has a satellite phone which she uses a number of times to talk to her relatives back home, and gain information that she couldn't access in a remote place. The phone is her only link to the outside world and it's interesting to see that she uses it less and less as the player progresses, since she becomes more independent and more curious. Throughout the levels, there are optional documents which can be discovered, that provide detailed insights on the world and its inhabitants. Some contain clues on how puzzles can be solved and most of them are just great reads that flesh out the story. My only gripe with the game is that backtracking is so excessive. Puzzles that could have been solved by player intuition is held back by dialogue checks and the need to show puzzle pieces bit by bit because of story reasons. There's even a section in the game where you have to go back and forth between two characters that are a minute away - in real time - from each other for at least 3 times, because one is too secretive and you have to persuade the other to spill the beans. Just a minor gripe and you'll get used to it somehow, but I hope that I'll never tread the same path again in the sequel.\nAnd there you have it.", "hours": 19.7, "username": "SoI|dCentur|0", "products": 289, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

Everything that is “good” about Syberia II is only relatively good when compared with the terrible Syberia I; there is nothing superlative about any facet of this game.\nA good thing about this game is that it has more cinematics than its predecessor. A game that sells itself on story should have many movies, and there are some here. For a game released in 2004 the visuals are not bad, but they haven’t aged well at all and alone they shouldn’t induce you to buy this game. Furthermore, the voice acting won’t make you wince as often; as when intonation is way of or a word is mispronounced, but you will definitely notice strange moments in the dialogue.\nThe main draw of this game is supposed to be the “amazing story” but here is the problem: it never develops beyond the premise that your protagonist wants to help an old guy reach Syberia (and still features the intelligence-insulting idea that he couldn't have gotten there when he built the rails the first time).\nIn general, stories depend on the quality of conflict for their weight, and the weak opposition and half-sketched puzzles (either extremely easy or nonsensical due to total lack of clues) simply don’t contribute any to a satisfying conclusion. It’s more like you progress through a series of trivial events and the game stops. Even in its most pretentious moments trying to induce pathos, the characters never manage to be any more impactful than a mildly annoying fly at the dinner table.\nSo what should induce you to buy this game? I can only imagine it must be the inflated ratings it seems to be getting elsewhere (why I tried when both games together were $3). Don’t bother unless you have time to waste and the patience of Job for flimsy characters (slightly less) annoyingly voiced.\nSPOILER PLOT COMPLAINT: One more thing I could leave off here-I couldn't believe it but the developers actually show you going so far north that you see Antarctic Emperor Penguins. Come on, were they complete idiots, or did they just think I'm one?\nREBUTTAL TO COMMENTS:\nOn the contrary, the first game sets up a (boring) storyline which the second fails to resolve satisfactorily. I am seriously surprised you are defending the storyline; clearly I am not the one who hasn't put much thought into what is going on. Problems with the second story are significant and in actuality are catastrophic, ruining what little immersion you got in the first game.\nPremise of the First Game:", "hours": 8.2, "user_id": "76561198050616539", "username": "Shokeyshah", "products": 118, "early_access": false},

From the very start players are thrust into a world similar to ours but not quite the same. As you explore the world and meet new characters more of the world slowly opens up, but more questions then arise. Syberia isn't what I would call a \"point and click thriller\" like the later Telltale games such as the Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. You don't kill anyone, rather there is very little violence at all compared to modern games. However that is what makes Syberia so special in this day and age. Syberia is somehow able to create a compelling world to explore with memorable characters without the use of hollywood-esque explosions or special effects. Kate Walker's adventure eventually turns into not just a simple business trip but a journey in search of her true self. The way this game presents the transformation of Kate Walker from a somewhat naive by the books girl to a strong independent woman is far more believable than Tomb Raider where Lara Croft suddenly transforms from innocent to murder machine within a few hours. Syberia presents the player with a mature story without the ludonarrative dissonance of today's big budget titles.\nThe actual gameplay is what you would expect from a traditional point and click, find items in your imventory for later use in a puzzle. But the puzzles are some of the most intriguing which I have ever seen in the genre. Nothing is rushed so you always have all the time you need to figure your way out of a problem. And problems you will have. Some of the puzzles in this game are so ingenious that even though this game is 14 years old at the time of this review I was still blown away by them. For example at various stages of the game in order to advance you must use your phone to call  the exact number on a document which you recieved. The game never tells you when to do this, it's up to the player to figure out.\nSyberia is an amazing game, but an old game nonetheless. There is no denying that the game's engine and visuals are slightly outdated by now. Animations are sometimes funky and the game will glitch out on newer OS's. That being said this game still has some of the best voice acting I've heard in a game and the art style/set pieces still amaze. The soundtrack still stands up to this day. The cutscenes are still extremely fluid and a joy to watch.\nSo in conclusion if you are either looking for a great point and click or simply a break from all the violence in today's mainstream gaming industry culture Syberia is a perfect purchase.", "hours": 1.9, "username": "certified sleepless owl", "products": 1801, "early_access": false},

But this game I had to put down after just getting in to chapter 2.\nI started the game with two impressions: 1. That it would be an overwhelmingly great experience (based on reviews), and 2. that I would be having an adventure in the cold and exciting lands of Siberia.  Neither was true.\nI did have a great \"feelilng\" about the gameworld in the first hours, mainly due to the artwork and lighting and \"ambience.\"  The main character had some... quirks... but I didn't mind at first.  And the \"puzzles\" were a little silly but I had decided at the outset to use a guide and avoid any frustrations with obscure puzzle solutions (see: Longest Journey).  So they were manageable, but tedious.  Maybe if I solved them on my own, I'd have found more reward in the puzzles, but I doubt it.\nBut it became very clear after a couple hours that there was nothing fun or engaging to do.  As I said, the setting was fantastic (even if I was wrong about thinking I'd be playing in Siberia).  But the story was only mildly compelling, the puzzles were not fun or clever, and the characters were truly annoying.  The main character is a huge stick in the mud.  Both the writing and the voice acting for the main character are unbearable.  The same goes for the robot and every side character you run into.\nAnd then there's the running around.  Its as bad as even the good reviews say it is.   And that was WITH using a guide.  I have a lot of patience, but it ran out with the running around and the \"This door is locked\" and the \"I don't need to pick this up yet.\"  The imaginative setting was not enough to deal with the pointless running around and flat out time-wasting activities.\nSo as much as I wanted to get into a good sub-zero adventure game, I just couldn't.  The game started out as relaxing, but soon became just plain boring, and what worse thing could be said about entertainment?  I had to make a hard choice to put it down without finishing, or waste many more hours doing something that just bores and annoys.\nI think this game might appeal to adults looking for a nostalgia fix, or possibly little kids with a lot of imagination.

Thanks to Benoît Sokal though, Syberia managed to build a touching, emotional tale around this pairing, then wrapped it into a classic style point ‘n’ click adventure game.\nLike most stories about old people chasing their old dreams, it is quite melancholic, but never too sentimental. There are no boring tales from a bygone era. Quite the opposite: in this game, we control an energetic New York lawyer, Kate Walker, who involuntarily ends up in an adventure from the French Alps to the heart of Russia, chasing the long-lost heir of a toy factory, so he can sign some sales contracts. Along the way, we learn a lot about this mysterious person and his life, and also meet some odd, but strangely memorable characters.\nThese people, like the whole setting, feel like as if they are stuck a century ago with their old clothes and the early 20th century buildings they live in. This anachronism works in the game’s favour, letting the player get immersed in the atmosphere and the slow-moving, yet great storyline.\nA warning though: when I said the story is slow, I meant it.

The short review: it isn't.\nI'll start by echoing the main criticism others have for this game: it's a point and click adventure, which is usually my kind of thing, but it doesn't have very much discovery. Especially in the first part of the game, you will spend an inordinate amount of time wandering through streets and paths with nothing in, only to accomplish one task before you have to click yourself to some other destination.\nThe characters are equally boring. You play Kate Walker, an American lawyer with no personality. Along the way, you'll meet other characters who stay around in the story for one particular plotline before disappearing without warning. The exception to this rule is the robot Oscar, whose obsession with regulation is more annoying than it is a character trait, and seems to make up most of the \"puzzles\", which aren't really puzzles as much as they are grindingly pointless obstacles that involve more wandering around aimlessly. Frequently, you'll also be called by your friends, boss, and mother, who all interrupt at inconvenient times to say much the same thing every time they call.\nWhen they do call, you'll often encounter another problem: the music. The music in the game is so loud that you'll struggle to hear the conversation you're supposed to be having and will have to rely on erratically spelt subtitles. It also seems to be largely random, playing out in some scenes but not in others, and is suspenseful at times where there is no suspense, causing the player to think something bad is going to happen when you're still just supposed to be clicking through endless screens.\nThe dialogue is also horrendously poor. When you get the option of talking to someone, you're presented with up to 8 one-word choices, which have very little connection to the question that Kate actually asks. For example, two that recur throughout the game are 'Mission' and 'Help', which imply the same thing but can be vastly different or frustrating similar. Another, 'Kate', can be anything from an introduction to something she's done or simply what she's thinking at the moment. This random style of conversation makes the game even longer than it needs to be.\nAnimation can be buggy too. For example, every time Kate\n, her shadow walks up the steps long after she does. It's weird that they bothered to include it in the game as broken, rather than just leave it out (and I wouldn't have noticed it if they had).\nIts ending is pretty bad too - I shan't spoil it, but there are two decisions Kate can make, and whereas the developers could have let the player choose, instead they force one upon you. It makes the conclusion of the game incredibly unsatisfying for the number of hours of wandering around you have to do to reach it.\nSome good points? Well, the art is nice (especially by 2002 standards), although the prioritisation of the art does lead to some problems (were you walking forwards? in the next screen, you'll have to walk to the left to go in the same direction, just so they can show you another artistic angle). The sound effects were probably my favourite part of the game; when they're not blasted over by music or the sound of repetitive clicking, they're actually quite immersive. Some of the concepts, like having a useable mobile phone, are pretty interesting.

Gameplay is of the bad old school adventure game variety, there are no failstates, but a good chunk of the puzzles just feel like tedious busywork, and the game loves its back and forth backtracking, and the areas can be kind of big, so I would suggest playing with a guide to save any frustration, also double-clicking to run is your friend. What really makes the game though it is its atmosphere and its thematic focus.\nSyberia has a really strong atmosphere, one of mystery, adventure, and wonder but as well as death, decay, lost hopes and forgotten dreams. Kate Walker’s journey to find Hans Voralberg takes her through several fictional European locations, all decaying into obscurity due to greed, selfish ambition, or just the ravages of time. The game is still beautiful even to this day and the locations just really get across the themes very well. The game also does a good job illustrating and building up Hans as a character and the creations he left in his wake in his decades long travel and how his wonder and creativity endured as the areas around him died or grew more cynical. Kate also has a nice character arc and that’s one of the main focuses of the game alongside Hans, and while it’s subtle as a brick at times, it still feels like a fulfilling journey.\nWhile there is Syberia 2, I have no desire in ever playing it because everything I seen of it is worse than its predecessor in every way, and it ruins the mysteries of the first game. I feel Syberia never needed a sequel at all because I think its ending is fulfilling enough, there are many mysteries still unanswered but I don’t think they ever needed to be, because as I said who Hans was and what Kate becomes were always the real focus of the game and the game ties those up with a nice bow. Overall Syberia is a flawed and aged game, but one with genuine heart that makes it worth playing.", "hours": 0.0, "username": "I AKU!", "products": 709, "early_access": false},

I'm rather forgiving about errors in these games, simply because I enjoy playing them in general. But this game... I simply couldn't continue playing it.\nI also love steampunk, so a game that combines both should be perfect for me, right? Right?\nWell... it says I played this game for 4.6 hours as I write this. And while I certainly love the environment and the art of the game... I can't enjoy the game itself. Why? Because the one word that describes this game best is: \"boring\".\nFirst of all, everything seems to take forever. You slowly walk from point to point, from scene to scene, and you just wish you could somehow fast forward. This gets particularly annoying if you have to cross like 4-5 screens (one of them may be a scrolling screen), just to get from one hotspot to another.\nSecond, the dialogues. They are long and tedious, and more often than not, nothing helpful is being said. You ask about one thing and they tell you that you don't need to know about that. Then you ask about the other and they tell you, you must first know the one thing you were told earlier that you don't need to know about it.\nSPOILERS\nThird, the story. You're a lawyer, travelling to a remote village to finalize a purchase deal for a factory. Does that sound exciting? Yeah, certainly does. You learn that the owner of the factory died shortly before you arrived, and struggle to still buy the factory for your client. Couldn't they think of a more exciting story?\nFourth, the phone calls. You witness random phone calls from Kate's mother, work colleague, boyfriend/fiance (amazing that she actually has signal in such a remote place) and learn about their relationships and stuff. As far as I can tell, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the story. It's probably supposed to add depth to the character. But was this really necessary?\nYes, I know, the game is old, 13 years by the time of this review. But that is not an excuse. There were great games before 13 years ago. There were great point & click games before 13 years ago. Look at the old Lucas Arts games. Indiana Jones, for example, was released 23 years ago, by the time of this review. And it was great. I played it over and over again.\nThis game, however... is just tedious. And boring.", "hours": 4.6, "user_id": "76561198077348744", "username": "Raen", "products": 582, "early_access": false},

This game did not brought anything new to genre, there is no challenging puzzles, but still, this is one of the best games in this niche.\nKate Walker, a young lawyer from the United States, arrives in tiny european town to sign a contract with owners of old toy factory. At first this journey looks like a routine job, but it quickly turns into long, difficult and amazingly interesting adventure.\nGame is very beautiful. Art style is fantastic, every screen is well created with a lot of attention for small details. Also, there is excellent, slightly melancholic soundtrack, that fits perfectly for the mood of the game.\nStoryline is well designed, characters are charismatic and it was especially interesting for me to observe how gradually changes the personality of Kate Walker. With time she realizes that money and career is not the most important thing in life, there is something else... something important and special. From my point of view, Kate Walker is attractive and interesting character, she got true individuality. Ending of the first part is one of the most touching scenes i had ever seen in games. I took a tissue.\nPuzzles are logical, they fit well in the story, i did not noticed anything annoying or non-logical. Puzzles are interesting enough but not difficult or challenging and maybe it is for the best, so they do not distract player from the story.\nCan i give a little criticism to this game? Well... i did not like the animation of characters. Kate Walker looks good enough, but other characters move as dummies. It looks especially ugly if compare animation of characters with stunningly beautiful suroundings.\nSometimes there is a little too much of old cliche. Crossing the border between Europe and Russia looks like expedition into depths of Mordor. And when it comes for Russia there is always \"slums, bums and drunkards\" and other \"winter-vodka-bear\" stuff. Well...\n...nevermind, i just can not criticise this game.

Also the clockwork fantasy theme appeals on a subjective level, and the script and voice acting are generally fine, bar a few odd casting moments (a cockney-scripted npc read in a jarringly posho way, for example) and fair few irritating characters. Puzzle-wise, the game is pretty fair, especially to begin with, and pixle-hunting is minimal throughout.\nHowever it grows increasingly exasperating, with multiple instances of a path, or action, somewhere behind you being arbitrarily \"unlocked\" only after completing an unrelated action, hence there is a lot of aimless back-tracking. This is made all the more painful, and less forgivable, by the lack of any \"fast-travel\" function, and the almost absurdly expansive areas go from being an asset to a curse. Some of this is excusable given the game's age, whereas some leads to the conclusion that the game was simply rushed, as the ambition shown by the landscape design isn't quite matched for quality by the rest of the game.\nOverall the game would be far better if the work done on the game-world was halved and that time was spent on polishing the puzzles and features instead.

I've played plenty of adventure games with click-based movement before, but what makes Syberia comparable in enjoyment to a lobotomy is that for at least the first half of the game 95% of the rooms and screens you run across have no objects, objectives, or point whatsoever except to look pretty, and you're left having to run across giant maps with maybe 3 useful rooms in them altogether, all of which are spread out.\nOh and here's the solution to every other puzzle: You need a key. Chances are it's nearby. If you don't need a key then prepare for some moderate-yet-annoying pixelhunting, and running through every room 3 times because you got everything right but now there's an extra little something you need to do that seems to have no point other than to add another 30+ minutes of \"gameplay\" to Syberia.\nI will say the story is interesting enough. It could've been more in-depth but that would've cut into Kate's marathon time I'm sure. I liked listening to Kate's phonecalls as a side-story. The art -as pointless as it was at times - was very well done and pretty especially considering when the game originially came out. And I really did love all the characters within the game, as the majority seem very well thought out.\nSyberia is pretty, interesting, and it sure does seem like a classic adventure.

Yeah, I do that sometimes, it's not even my genre. But wow, I got myself a piece of gold here. I am not much into the Point'n'Click genre as said, but it is good to know that there are games like this which convince me to actually poke my head below the surface (poor metaphors, yay. no seriously wtf did I just write there).\nWell, technically and graphically, this game is... well. Just keep it's age in mind, it's from 2002 yo. But considering that, these backgrounds are just WOW. Probably some of the prettiest and most detailed I know of (operative word is 'I'). Cought myself acting up to take a neat screenshot here and there.\nThe gameplay is quite slow paced, like in most of the genre's games (I guess; me lacking experience here) - But sometimes I could strangle Kate for her unbearable stair-walking behavior (JUST CLIMB 'EM DOWN ALREADY ahh, wrong side of the train again FML), just saying. The puzzles are mostly comprehensible and challenging enough so that even a beginner like me can solve them just by thinking. No actual brain- or logic breakers here (I still had to take a walkthrough four or five times, but mainly thanks to my own stupidity). The items are mostly located at logical places, the solution may be even located just next to the keyhole where it should be by logic. I like this!\nThe story is really intense for what I have felt. I actually felt the necessity to accomplish Kate's mission in the first place and solve the problems not for the problems' sake, but to finally get to that damn Hans. Just like Kate, over the time I really got involved into the story behind the automatons and their creators (I inhaled EVERY document - including Anna's wole diary). I can't remember being confused about details that I didn't catch - simply because I did NOT miss out on anything. This is a rare event in more gameplay-driven games like shooters - maybe I should play more games of this kind; or play games in my native language more often... on the other hand... ugh, still prefer the original voices. German localization sucks in most cases. anyway B2T\nLong story short: I had tons of fun playing it and figuring out the ways through the story. It became one of these games I enjoyed putting 14 hours of my precious free time into without regrets. The end came a bit sudden for my taste, but the story does not end there; and some day I WILL get myself the sequel(s), definitely.\nI can just highly recommend this game to whoever is looking for an involving, story driven experience with an interesting setting - and maybe, like me, having never touched Point'n'Click before.\nAnd if you are really, REALLY not interested into that genre AT ALL... Man, still give this one a try.\nI did, too.\nPS: Maybe it is just me, but I think I had some sound issues on Windows10, which (I am sure of) weren't there on Windows7. Some of the sceneries had almost no sound at all.

(double clicking makes her speed up if she has a flat stretch)\nDon't get me wrong, it's all really cool the first time you see new scenery in the game, but after the first time it's nothing but irritating speed-bumps. There is no map, so definitely no fast travel.  If there were, I would probably enjoy the game instead of only being able to play for an hour at a stretch...by which time anyone tries to talk to me and I explode.\nThough I am enjoying the main story, a strange kinda mystical story about a female lawyer on the trail of a guy who builds automatons and went in search of mammoths...I would like to see where they go with that bizarre premise...I don't like the side story of the lawyer's life played out in calls she gets on her mobile phone.  [*spoiler*]  The people in her life are selfish, shallow, demanding and uncaring...and she's a complete doormat.  I cringe when her phone rings.  I am sure in the end she tells everyone to take a flying leap because otherwise she is the worst female protagonist ever, but she isn't likeable enough to care.  It's hard to root for someone who takes abuse cheerfully. [*end spoiler*].\nFrom what I have seen so far, I estimate the game only has 3 hours of worthwhile game-play but the devs have made it so you can't possibly complete the game in less than 10 hours.  That's a helluva lot of filler.  I don't know if I can bring myself to ever finish it...I think I'd rather pull weeds.", "hours": 8.3, "user_id": "76561198001362759", "username": "Gana", "products": 555, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false},

Nowadays it looks and feels dated. That being said, if you have an opportunity and like point and click adventure games then definitely carve out some time for this one.\nThis game, unfortunately, falls short in a few key areas. The writing is weak, the characters are not terribly complex, and it is rife with clumsy dialogue. Our hero, Kate Walker, is pushed around by an uncaring boss with unrealistic expectations, a fiancé who is the biggest jerk in the whole world who cares absolutely nothing for the needs of Kate and her own ambitions in life, and a \"best friend\" who thinks she should just stop all this 'having a job' stuff and get back to being a 'good wife' to Dan the previously mentioned fiancé.\nThe interactions with these shallow one dimensional characters is punctuated by phone calls in which the writers try to draw out a character arc with Kate that literally has one of them saying, \"Wow Kate, you've changed so much in the past few days.\" Perhaps this passed for decent writing in the past, but nowadays it just seems rough and juvenile as if the writers had no idea how to write a strong female character.\nThere are moments in which I found myself rooting on Kate as she told off Dan, solved puzzles, and bested the very jerks she had been placed in this world with but all in all I began to dread the phone calls, the interactions and the conversations with other characters. The puzzles were the biggest relief from that.\nUnfortunately some of the puzzles suffered from hints that were too vague and ground the game to a standstill without referring to a walkthrough. Thankfully these were few and far between and in general the game had fantastic puzzles that were challenging and intuitive while being fulfilling.\nUltimately, this game does what point and click adventure games do well: provide a story to generate a plot driven reason to solve puzzles. I just wish the story weren't so aggravating, the characters so thin, and the conversations so utterly long winded.\nOverall 6/10", "hours": 15.7, "username": "Dollarwise Gamers", "products": 941, "early_access": false},

I used to play Sierra games back in the day and Syberia is an artifact of its time, which makes it rather slow, linear, and obtuse from a modern viewpoint.\nNo, what bugs me about Syberia is its savoir faire. It has a style, and that's fine... but when that style is built with backstory and plot to basically make a Gary Stu the most important man in the world, where everyone must love him if they have a soul, and everyone /does/ love him because he's so special... that bugs me. Okay, so there's a guy who's such a mechanical genius that he can make mechanical life. Fine. But then he makes all his mechanisms toys because he's simple, you see, he's so innocent and pure. If that's not saccharine enough to make your teeth hurt, the developers start to assume you're some sort of mouthbreather and actually spell it out for you: he is pure and innocent and just and kind and has never done anything wrong ever, in pretty much so many words.\nMaybe it's because I'm an engineer by trade, but the game smacks of an alternate history wondering why we couldn't all be more innocent. Why couldn't our society be made by toymakers with quaint clockwork mechanisms running everything? Others have spoken about how the game is anti-American; I think it's more anti-modern since it hails back to pastoral scenes in rural towns and, of course, the clockwork... yet as much as they say that the Good Old Days were so great, said Good Old Days never were and the clockwork fantasy underlines that they don't even want to sacrifice anything for the Good Old Days. We want our toymaker utopia, but with faster, better trains and /artificial life/ slave labor. I've no time for backwards-looking utopias, since the past wasn't as great as everyone makes it out to be. I've got even less time than that for backwards-looking utopias that want all of the benefits of technological society without any of its drawbacks, because mechanical magic will somehow keep the spring-loaded spaceships from being missiles or the wind-up automatons from being soldiers or the super-fast super-green trains from being tanks.", "hours": 10.8, "username": "The Centipede", "products": 324, "early_access": false},

The backgrounds are very well done; I especially liked the haunting look of the shipwrecks around Aralbad.  The soundtrack is pretty and not intrusive, contributing to the cutscenes especially.\nThere are some bad points.  As a few reviews have already mentioned, movement slower than slow, and even the double-click-to-run mechanic doesn't save some parts from taking for-freaking-ever to complete.  I also discovered about halfway through that I could right-click to skip dialogue in case I accidentally clicked something I didn't mean to.  I would've loved to have known that earlier as I suffered through long repeated conversations.\nDespite the backgrounds being visually stunning, the character models themselves show their age and I learned that, at least on my system, alt-tabbing caused some graphical difficulties.  Nothing was game breaking and most glitches cleared themselves up if I changed rooms/views, but it was irritating for me as a chronic multitasker.\nThe only part of the game that was almost a dealbreaker for me was the character development, not of Kate (your playable character) but of the people she interacted with by phone throughout the game.  The selfish, shallow jerk of a fiancé, the annoying, shallow mother, the ethically-questionable, shallow best friend....all of them were honestly awful.  The worst was Kate's interaction with Dan; where she should've told him to♥♥♥♥♥♥off after roughly the second conversation, she instead kept taking responsibility for his poor behavior.  Even as her character developed more of a spine as the story went on, her interactions with him were still grating.  He was a self-obsessed ghoul throughout and I honestly wanted to run our little train right over him.  No combat in this game, but he might make you regret that.\nBut, the rest of the story was extremely unique and very truly overcomes the glitches, the slow speed, and the ridiculously badly-written supporting cast (Hans and Helena are notable exceptions to this, though, they're delightful).

As a result you can spend a lot of time backtracking and sitting through conversations you already had just so you can interact with an unrelated object elsewhere, which in turn unlocks another long dialog in the first location. This would be fine if the characters were compelling, but the universe is just not particularly to my tastes - it is sort of a quirky magical realist steampunky thing that makes me wish I could get back to the \"real life\" story on the other end of the phone.

So here it is, unedited:\nGames such as this one bring smile to my face. Why? Because I was initially an adventure game player and the last few years have been quite bad for this genre. Ever since Sierra and LucasArts stopped their production of adventures and turned over to the more profitable games, a few developers have even tried to do something. The only true masterpiece that I can think of at the moment is Funcom’s The Longest Journey, while Dreamcatcher’s creations were far from what we really need (still, my congratulations to Dreamcatcher for even trying where others don’t bother at all!). I doubt the situation will get any better soon, but Syberia might prove that there’s a lot that adventures can provide, especially to young gamers.\nIn this 3rd person adventure you play a role of Kate Walker, a young lawyer from New York who was sent to Valadilene, a little town in France to complete the deal of purchasing a local toy factory for a huge multinational company. Unfortunately, the owner of the factory Anna Voralberg has just passed away and her only heir, her brother Hans is nowhere to be found. This is where your adventure begins.\nThe story might not sound like it’s anything special, but it’s actually amazing! As you do your research to find Hans, you will discover a lot about the Voralberg family, their toy factory and Hans’ maniacal obsession with automatons and mammoths. You will even meet a few automatons made by Hans, robots with their own character! Your journey will also take you to the weird university in Barrockstadt in Germany where you’ll meet more weird people, then to Russian mining city ruled by a lunatic and so on. Everywhere you go you will get into a bit abnormal situations but you’ll get used to it.\nUnfortunately, most of the puzzles are rather easy and each problem can be solved in a real short time. Still, since there are many locations and a lot of puzzles you won’t notice this often. I got stuck in only two occasions and both times it really was my fault – once I had to use a cell phone and the other time I just didn’t see the closet that contained two important items. Also, there is no item combination at all, making everything a lot easier as well.\nNow I must mention the visuals of Syberia. The graphics are simply amazing! It’s obvious that a lot of effort was put into the visual side of this great game. A few screens of the game exist only to show the beautiful scenery such as the side view of the Barrockstadt University or the resort hotel in Russia. The same applies to the sound as the game features some fine, classical tunes specific to the region in which you are at the moment. I especially liked the music in Russia, which sounded a lot like the old Soviet anthem. The complete game is voice covered and the voice acting is probably the best I’ve heard lately!\nOverall, Syberia may be a bit easy for the experienced players but it’s a true masterpiece in the genre. I was delighted to see normal controls unlike in a lot of similar games that I had a chance to play in the last 15 months or so. It’s all point&click, like in good old times. Syberia is a well-made game, with an intriguing story and even a little soap opera that goes on over Kate’s cell phone. I can’t give it a score larger than 82% due to easy puzzles, but … good work by Microids, I am hoping to see more of their work soon!\nPlus: Magnificent graphics and sound, intriguing story, easy controls.\nMinus: Easy puzzles, some pixel hunting.", "hours": 20.6, "username": "Atebash", "products": 1631, "early_access": false},

The environments are empty, but mysterious and interesting. It's also a design choice: the only objects you can interact with are objects that the main character, \"Miss Kate Walker\", wants to pick up or use or talk to.\nThus there's little commentary on the surroundings. No \"look at cliff\" or \"pick up microwave\" - just a few hotspots.\nWhich, to my disappointment, are easy to miss. There is no \"press a button to reveal all points of interest\" functionality. And many of the puzzles are obtuse. The game makes you run around a lot. Often multiple times through same places. Luckily the backgrounds are gorgeous and atmospheric (made even more so by the musical score). Also, an FAQ comes very handy, unless you like running around aimlessly. The game mostly shows its age in how off-putting and non-user-friendly its design often is. Which is a shame. If they ever make an HD remake - they should! - these are issues they should fix.

Your expanded inventory allows you to access and reference important documents, as well as to call NPC's from your cell phone.\n- An interesting plot hook that will propel your character through four unique quest/puzzle hubs.\n- The snarky comments from Oscar and James.\nThe okay:\n- The puzzles are very intuitive; however, I did run into trouble a few times because I either missed a dialogue cue that was necessary to advance a puzzle, or I overlooked a small clickable object due to undelineated bounding boxes.\n- There are several large screens that have absolutely nothing to interact with.  They may be pretty to look at, but they make backtracking a bit of a pain.\n- The music is good, but some of the themes are overplayed.\nThe ugly:\n- Can we talk about the female protagonist?  She is introduced as a hot-shot international corporate lawyer, so I thought she was going to be savvy and assertive, but she spends most of the game being emotionally manipulated by her fiance, being verbally abused by her bosses, having her femininity questioned by her backstabbing shallow co-worker, having her life choices questioned by her overbearing frivolous mother, and being jerked around by various unsavory NPC's.  The few times she starts to stick up for herself, she actually back-peddles and APOLOGIZES, and seems to be completely okay with people treating her like a doormat.

It should be a straight-forward task but things take a turn which ends up in her traveling across various fictional locations in Europe.\nThe gameplay was fairly straight-forward.

The storytelling was deep and apart from the main plot, the player also got insights into Kate's personal life as the hours wore on. Notebooks, letters, diary entries and pamphlets were essential to understanding the background story, which was very interesting.\nBack-tracking and running around can be a bit of a grind.

The puzzles are logical, but also not challenging. The main flaw is the very slow pace of the game and the lack of any way to speed up the main characters movement. Only play if you have a lot of patience.\nLong Story: This recommendation comes with a very big caveat. Syberia is an old-school point and click adventure with none of the modernizations that make those games easier to play. No fast-travel at all (not even dubble-clicking to immediately change scene), no way to see interactionable items except hovering over them or indicating which paths you can take. Steam says it took me about 10 hours to finish Syberia, but I would estimate that maybe 1½ hour was spent on puzzles, another 1½h on dialogue and the other 7 hours were spent on watching the main character run around or climb stairs. There are a lot of stairs in Syberia and you will climb them all. There are also a lot of travel frames that you have to get through to get to places with interactable items. They look very nice, but it is still a bit of wasted time.\nThis means that you should only play Syberia if you have a lot of patience for the incredibly slow pace of the game. If you have the patience, the game rewards you with very nice set-pieces, good dialogue and a nice story. You play as Kate Walker, american lawyer, sent to finalize the sale of a toy factory, only to find the owner dead of old age and the heir missing in the far north of Siberia. Walker starts off as a somewhat unlikable character (lowest point is probably asking a handicapped kid to pick up an oar for her because it is wet and icky), but has a chance to grow throughout the game by overcoming problems and meeting weird people.\nThe puzzles are mostly logical. The difficulty lies more in spotting items and finding all locations that are available. As soon as you have the items and know which locations are available, it is very easy to know what to do. So if you're looking for a challenge then Syberia is not the game for you.\nI am recommending Syberia because I liked the story, the settings and the characters. However, it would be a far superior game with the ability to quickly move from scene to scene and some indication of which paths are available. As it is, it is an incredibly slow game that you need a lot of patience to play.", "hours": 10.6, "user_id": "76561198045208825", "username": "Shatiz", "products": 541, "early_access": false},

In the interest of fairness I probably should note that the game indeed is more than ten years old.\nThe dialog and story line problem:\nWhen I ask about \"Y\" I am told that \"Y\" is not relevant, when I ask about \"X\" I am told that I need to know about \"Y\" first. Same thing with the places your character can visit. You can choose to go to place \"1\", \"2\" or \"3\", but if you go to \"2\" or \"3\" you are told that it is not time for that yet - in a more game like fashion than that - but the point remains valid.\nConclusion:\nAll in all, if you are looking for a computer adventure game I suggest you spend your money on something better than \"Syberia\". On the other hand, if you are looking for a graphic story to click yourself through instead of yet another movie night then \"Syberia\" might just be worth a dollar or two - in my opinion not more than that though - certainly not ten!", "hours": 13.0, "user_id": "76561198009559328", "username": "Rodhern", "products": 90, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false},

What will detract your attention is the poor voice acting from Americans attempting to be Eastern Europeans. Never in my life have I heard such distinct New York accents pass off as what I presume to be Russian, but the accents weren't Russian at all, just American.\nAnyway, you play as Kate Walker, a lawyer sent in from NYC to some European town to secure a buy-out from a toy factory. Problem is, one of the heirs of the owning family is still alive so Kate Walker has to journey in this strange land of robot-like manufacturing (Automatons) and find Hans Voralburg. There's a mystery surrounding this man as he was presumed dead many years ago. And on your way to meet Hans, you discover secrets, make friends with a robot (Automaton) named Oscar and ride an awesome train.\nThe game is a point and click adventure, so don't expect any difficulty besides using logic and common sense when grabbing clues to progress and make machines work; I guess they could be called puzzles. I have to say that the graphics are mostly impressive; I wish the resolution could be changed from....I think it was 800x600. The only other thing that bothered me with the graphics was Kate Walker's running animation. It's obviosly a cycle, but her head bobs extensively from side to side instead of bobbing up and down slightly; being an animator myself I found that was just a bit annoying. I also didn't like the subplot of getting cell phone calls every now and then from Kate's fiance and mother and employer. The dialog from them was frustratingly bad and the whole thing with them felt unnecessary.\nOverall, pretty good game. 8/10", "hours": 10.9, "user_id": "76561198009430218", "username": "WackyDelly", "products": 814, "early_access": false},

Although the theme of the story doesn't seem special at all, but designers must be complimented for building a haunting gameplay upon it. Elements of longing, mysticism, fantasy, and mystery are well-blended, and make you want to play further and further. Dialogues are well-written and entertaining. Visuals are nothing special. While playing it on a 24\" 1080p monitor wasn't a great experience--the blurry edges around all objects were quite visible, they didn't impede my enjoyment in any sense. Puzzles are quite straight-forward, and don't require any critical thinking skills on your part; you just have to be alert to your surroundings at all times. If there's an object or character that you can interact with, be assured it has some use in the game.\nThe only major irritant in the game is its tedious gameplay. Your character will need to walk around a lot in order to figure out the problems and proceed further in the game. All that could've been bypassed by making the character appear at the location of interest with a single click. But no, the designers make you watch the character walk all the way to the desired location, which will make you impatient; you might even turn-off the game in anger--only to return a few hours later :).\nSCORE: 7/10 (3 points deducted for tedious gameplay, average visuals, and unintelligent game design)\nPS: To finish the story, you will need to play this game along with Syberia II.", "hours": 14.9, "username": "akg1249", "products": 768, "early_access": false},

In my opinion the lack of difficulty that I've experienced in the present is due to the fact that  I've got more experienced with solving puzzles and because I think that with the age you see things differently, more logical. Returning back to the game, the story is quite good, although the characters seem too polite in my opinion even when confronted with dangerous situations, the puzzles are interesting and can be somewhat difficult for someone new to the game, the graphics are nice, the gameplay and audio are good, overall this is a good adventure game.

Maybe it's because it's more of a interactive cinematic experience than a game, but it seems so unnecessarily long. While you'll get ~10+ hrs of playtime, most of it is spent walking/running/climbing stairs and trying useless locked doors around rather than solving puzzles. There seem to be gratuitous long shots and panning shots of scenery that serve no other purpose than to show off the scenery, because there isn't anything that can be interacted with in those scenes, which means lots and lots of walking/running to get to the next screen. There are also lots of stairs and ladders that cause Kate Walker to slow down and climb step by step and normal pace. Throw in some backtracking and the minutes of walking/running/climbing add up to hours.\nFor a game with a story, sometimes you have no idea what you're doing since it's rather easy to do things before they make any narrative sense, especially in Valadilene where you aren't told much of anything. Mostly, in the first two areas (Valadilene and Barockstast), you're just wandering around trying locked doors because there are no maps or directions to so-and-so place you're supposed to go. You'd think Kate Walker would at least try to ask someone where the notaary was or the rector's office instead of wasting time running around trying to find the place.\nThe story felt flat to me. It doesn't really go anywhere for most of the game and ends in a cliffhanger. You get Kate Walker's backstory through incessant phone calls that interrupt gameplay, but the subplot or even Kate Walker's story seems pointless in the grand scheme of things. Every phone conversation felt like Kate Walker didn't particularly care, even though her relationships were falling apart. That's probably no surprise given how she has no qualms about breaking and entering, theft, and manipulating people, but given how every NPC is incompetent, unhelpful or insane, that's probably the only way the story advances.\nIt's frustrating how almost every NPC is incompetent, cowardly unhelpful, and/or insane. In fact, the incompetency and cowardice drive the puzzles on the journey to search for the heir, and the puzzle aren't even directly related to the plot. It's just multiple long chains of small favor type quests after Valadilene.

If you have a lot of patience you should really try it out.\nOn with the points of improvement in my opinion. This game is not an open world at all, at a lot of doors, Kate will tell you to 'not go down there'. On the one side this is logical, due to the fact that the player will not know where to look for the next clue, on the other side; do not make the doors clickable if the door is no use. Next to that, I did some running around and got to the next clue after 5 'empty' screens. When the clue was found I had to go back the same way.. this really tested my patience.\nAll-in-all: If it wasn't for the low price I paid, I would be less positive about this game.

There are many things to admire in this game, such as the details in the character and background animations, the absolutely gorgeous environments, and the creativite plot and settings. You can definitely feel the love and effort the developers put into the game. It's hard for me to describe one of the best things that Syberia does well... but I'm going to try: the world it creates is not exactly exciting, but rather relaxing in its wonderment. The atmosphere is calming and whimsical. There are no death screens, no way for you to mess up or have to start over, just you exploring a rich world. Although it might not be big on action, Syberia definitely has a lot to say. Throughout the narrative as Kate changes, the game tells both her and the player that you are capable of much more than you think. The game will move you at parts, if you let it.\nKeep in mind there is a sequel to this game, so some issues are left unresolved, but I feel that even without a sequel, the themes and character arcs of this story work well, even standing alone.\nA few things that detract from the game are the inability to make Kate move faster during some animations like walking up stairs which makes backtracking irritating, some difficult puzzles that you might need a walkthrough for, and interactive items that are sometimes easy to miss. I highly recommend using a walkthrough if you get stuck to prevent the hair-pulling frustration of combing over every pixel on the screen to find something to help you progress the game. (I don't like using walkthroughs myself, but I had to bend in this case.)\nHowever, these things ultimately do not take away from how much the world will enthrall you, and how much you won't want to leave when the story ends.

I was disappointed. While the game is one of the few to actually present an original premise (so many are derivatives of a “you are a quiet antihero looking for vengeance”) the entirety of the plot is really presented in the first few minutes of the game. Character development takes place through a series of phone calls which are supposed to show the personal growth of the main character through the use of a sub-plot, but really have no connection to the main events of the game, nor do they server to connect you to the hero. It is also unfortunate that the English voice-acting (can’t speak for other language tracks) is overdone, so that you find yourself skipping dialogue lines as quickly as you can read them, rather than listen to the hammy delivery. In spite of this, I could still have lived with the story, were it not for a number of serious troubles with the plot (see spoiler section to read my beefs).\nStory was to be my main attraction, but the game still could have been saved by looking pretty or playing well. Graphics have aged considerably, and no longer look presentable (excepting fixed-angle, pre-rendered scenery), while the game features a boring “click and wait while your character walks slowly across the screen” interface. This dynamic is exacerbated by the fact that many puzzles have you walking from one place to another to deliver an item or take a second look at an area now opened by dialogue.\n***************\nSPOILER ALERT – Complaints about Story\n***************\nHans sent plans so a train could be built.

I'm judging it in 2014, so it's hard to put on your 2002-goggles and see the game when those mediums weren't nearly as popular as they are now. It has fantastic art, a unique setting, and the sort of characters you'd want in any form of fiction, but the gameplay isn't just plodding and unchallenging, it completely detracts from the experience. Even when you know exactly what to do or where you want to go, you often have to traverse multiple empty, pointless, often pretty scenes. It takes 5 minutes to do absolutely anything (start run animation, come to full stop, change scene, start run animation...) and much of the game involves running back and forth between 2-3 points. It's certainly not a bad experience, but it wasn't one I needed to spend 8 hours on.

I guess it got marks for being released at a time when no one was making point-and-click adventures so it was the only way for fans of the genre to get ther fix.\nFirst off it has really boring puzzles. The only time I ever got stuck was when I couldn't believe that the puzzles could be that simple. Yeah, the genre gets flak for having incomprehensible logic behind the puzzles, but that's a huge part of what made them fun and memorable. That ah-ha moment when you find the designer's line of logic and it all comes together. I'm streching to even call these puzzles. One major one involves tring to fix a mechanical bandstand. The first part of the puzzle is basically a trading quest to get the obvious item needed to open it up and when I got inside I assumed there would be some kind of Myst style mechanical puzzle to fix it. Nope, you pull a lever and it's solved. That's this game's puzzles in a nutshell.\nThen there's this game's travesty of a traslation and dialogue. It's not even hilariously bad ala Kings Quest V. You're travelling across Europe for ♥♥♥♥'s sake and maybe three character's even speak with a European accent. Who directed these voice actors? Did they even read the title of this game much less the description? Then the writing alternated between bad drama and bad witty banter. Not ever offensively bad and at times there's a spark of charm about it, but coupled with dull gameplay it's hard to care.\nI will give the game points for visuals. It looks a lot like Final Fantasy VIII with a lot of old looking European architecture that speaks of a long history, but also of areas that have hit hard times with building slowly falling apart and mechanical things beginning to go to rust. The game has an appealing alternate present aesthetic going on that isn't explored much, but I still kind of liked it.

Сюжет просто великолепен- в нём есть загадочные герои,а также запутанная история,которую хочется прожить не отрывая глаз от монитора.\nВобщем я советую поиграть в эту игру тем,кому важен сюжет,а не графика!!!", "hours": 6.6, "user_id": "76561198059820079", "username": "GGwpILyusha", "products": 193, "early_access": false},

Not a profession you’d expect as a protagonist for an adventure, but her story is quite amazing; she is sent to the French Alps to secure the takeover bid of a quaint yet amazing toy factory. The factory once produced clockwork implements of all kinds, not just toys. Most of their stock in trade was automatons, known in other fiction as robots, but  here the word is a strangely applied racist slur for those who respect the “soul” of these creatures.\nThat “soul” came about as a result of the automatons’ inventor, Hans Voralberg. A brilliant yet reclusive young man, he suffered an accident in his youth which caused his overbearing, perfectionist (and some might say short-sighted) father to lose all respect for him. His intelligence ironically skyrocketed after the injury (which I will not spoil here), but he remained physically and mentally stunted. This didn’t keep him from working on his creations, which were powered by wind-up mechanisms very similar to clocks.\nOn his eighteenth birthday, Hans suffered another accident, this one tragically costing his life… or so his father would have the townspeople believe. Your first mission in the game is seeking out the sole remaining owner of the factory, Hans’s sister, Anna. Unfortunately, she too has died, of old age this time. As you talk to the townspeople, you will find what Hans and Anna’s work meant to them, as well as discover a lingering secret, and go on an epic journey with a wonderful train and eccentric automaton conductor…\nGameplay proceeds much like the classic point-and-click adventures of old, which I love dearly. Walk around four major “worlds,” all tragically failed utopias which were nonetheless touched by Hans’ influence (as we’ll find, Hans was quite a traveler in his life): the small, isolated village of Valadilene, the academy at Barrockstadt, the Russian space-race-era launch pad at Komkolzgrad, and the opulent spa at Aralbad. Will Kate find the signature she’s looking for, or will she discover something altogether new and grand which causes her to forget about the mundane and embrace the improbable?\nA sequel was also released (and another is also due to be released, next year perhaps) which chronicles Kate’s further adventures with Hans (yes, he’s very much alive after all this time!) and their amazing wind-up train, in their continuing journeys to find Syberia, the ancient land beyond Siberia where Hans believes mammoths to still exist. More strange and wondrous lands and people await your interaction!\nA lovely and wonderful series very worthy of your attention!
